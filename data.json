They fan their tail feathers and inflate their necks while letting out a murmuring coo, hoping that a female selects them. This communal display is called lekking, and though we only see two birds here, these groups can number up to 200. Black grouse aren't the only animals known to participate in leks—bats, paper wasps, Atlantic cod, and fiddler crabs are among the many other species which go to the same lengths to find the right mate.\nLearn more\nMake Bing your homepage\nExperience beauty every day\nNever miss a moment and keep search at your fingertips.

What truly matters is that this friendly, intelligent, curious, and companionable animal is here among us today. A lover of high places and eternally interested in watching what you are doing, the Abyssinian’s exquisite list of traits is the perfect answer that cat fanciers can offer to those who love their dogs. It can do so many dog-like things, yet it also knows where the litter box is and what it is used for.\n©A-Z-Animals.com\nSee all of our expert product reviews .\nBreed History\nThe origin of the Abyssinian cat breed is shrouded in mystery. It was once believed that the Abyssinians were cats imported from Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), but the cat actually earned the name in reference to the Abyssinian War, and some cats during that period were imported by colonialists to Europe. These cats were exhibited in cat shows in the 1800s and called “Abyssinians.” But there’s no proof that those imported cats were true early Abyssinians.\nRecent genetic tests have shown that the Abyssinian breed most likely originated in parts of Southeast Asia and the coast of the Indian Ocean. The earliest example of an Abyssinian is a taxidermal exhibit that was purchased between 1834 and 1836 by a museum supplier. It was labeled “Patrie, domestica India,” and is still on exhibit at the Leiden Zoological Museum in the Netherlands.\nWhile it’s one of the oldest cat breeds in the world, the Abyssinian breed’s exact origins are mysterious.\n©iStock.com/anobis\nArticles Mentioning Abyssinian\n9 Coolest Types Of Cat Breeds\nOrange Tabby Cats: Everything You Need to Know\n10 Types of African Dog Breeds\nThe Top 10 Oldest Cat Breeds Ever\n10 Domestic Cats That Look Like Tigers, Cheetahs, and Leopards\n7 Cats That Look Like Leopards (With Pictures!)\nTop 10 Most Beautiful and Prettiest Cats\nTop 10 Strongest Cats\nTop 10 Friendliest Cats\nTop 10 Smartest Cat Breeds\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nArticles Mentioning Abyssinian\nTop 10 Strongest Cats\nThe 10 Best Emotional Support Animals\nTop 10 Most Beautiful and Prettiest Cats\nTypes of Exotic Cats\nGuinea Pig as a Pet: How to Care for Your Guinea Pig\n7 Cats That Look Like Leopards (With Pictures!)\n9 Yellow Cat Breeds & Yellow Cat Names\nTop 10 Smartest Cat Breeds\n8 Red Cat Breeds & Red Cat Names\nTypes of Egyptian Cat Breeds\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nTraits: What To Know Before You Buy\nThe most important thing to know about an Abyssinian, or Aby for short, is that you are not getting a couch potato out of the deal. If you don’t want to be followed around and have a cat underfoot, you should think about some other pet. Abyssinians are born to superintend your activities or those of other members of your family.\nThere are cats that like to be under things and cats that like to be above things. If you can’t find your Aby, then look up. Despite speculation that their ancestors came from a desert environment, the current breed is very fond of trees and other high perches.\nHealth and Entertainment for your Abyssinian\nSee all of our expert product reviews .\nAbyssinians are famously good-natured so long as they have been properly introduced. They can peacefully co-exist with birds , dogs , small children, and even goldfish. If you’ve ever fancied having a cat that can play fetch, you may well get your wish with an Abyssinian.\nDomestic cats live on a diet of cat food, but when roaming free will also eat rodents, birds, and fruits.\nPersonality\nIf there is one complaint about an Abyssinian’s personality, it may perhaps be that they are almost too smart. They love to learn, and they learn by observing things at close quarters. This means that they are not shy about getting into your business while you are doing it.\nThey are also very good at figuring out how to get into things or spaces that you may not want them in. These inquisitive creatures always want to know what’s on the other side of that barrier.\nOne area that often surprises people about the Abyssinian personality is that they are very affectionate but notoriously disinterested in being a lap cat. They like curling up beside you, not on top of you. In this position, they are perfectly content to let you pet them and scratch their ears but they are not noted for being a cat you hold or carry around.\nWhile Abyssinians are open-minded about their companions in life, they do like having others of one sort or another around. No matter if it is a human or another cat, they are very sociable and can become bored and destructive if left alone too much.\nThey have very loud motors when it comes to purring but they balance this with the rather sparse use of their voice. If they talk, it’s because there is a topic of importance they wish to discuss with you.\nWhile affectionate, Abyssinians are notoriously disinterested in being lap cats.\nSize And Weight\nThe Abyssinian is a medium to small size breed of cat. Although medium in overall size, their very lithe build, and thin legs make them register on the smaller end of that medium scale so far as weight is concerned.\nAbys generally run from 8 to 10 inches in height and is anywhere from 12 to 16 inches in length. They tip the scales at a svelte 8 to 12 lbs.\nThe average Abyssinian Cat will weigh between 8 and 12lbs and reach a height of 8 to 10 inches.\n©Martin Bahmann / Creative Commons\nPrices\nAs purebred cats, Abyssinians are not inexpensive pets. Kittens can cost anywhere from $500 to $2200. Rarer Abyssinians and those coming from premier bloodlines can run all the way up to $5000.\nThe wild card in this is that you can obtain an Abyssinian kitten for much less than these numbers indicate, but they are not capable of being used to breed more Abyssinians. For a so-called “pet” Aby, you can find common ones in the $500-900 range. Without getting into exotic toys, expensive foods, or unanticipated health issues, the average cost of maintaining an Abyssinian is about $400 a year.\nAbyssinians are typically priced from $500-$2200, while those with premier bloodlines can cost $5000.\n©iStock.com/Smartha_Martha\nKittens\nLike most other cats, Abyssinians have litters in the range of about six kittens. Kittens tend to be somewhat darker than their parents when born but will lighten up as their distinctive coat develops.\nThey reach full height in about six months. After that, they gradually put on bulk until they are fully developed at around one year from their birth.\nLike their parents, the kittens are very playful and intelligent. They make wonderful pets for children to grow up with.\nAbyssinian kittens tend to be born with darker coats than their parents, which lighten as they grow older.\n©ingret/Shutterstock.com\nLifespan\nTheir curious nature and love of heights can artificially shorten their natural lifespan due to accidents. Barring any early death due to misadventure, however, Abyssinians easily last into the 13-15 year range. With proper care and diligence, living into their 20s is not too uncommon.\nGiven the large initial investment in acquiring one, Aby owners usually watch their cat’s health very carefully and tend to their veterinary needs promptly. This means that Abyssinians are less likely to develop conditions that require them to be euthanized at an earlier age.\nTheir longevity is also helped by their endomorphic body characteristics and their generally vigorous levels of activity throughout their lives. Conversely, the relatively small genetic stock of the breed has led to some lingering hereditary issues that appear more often in Abyssinians than in the general cat population.\nThe longevity of the typical Abyssinian is aided by its endomorphic body characteristics and vigorous levels of activity throughout its life.\n©Vlad Thepesh/Shutterstock.com\nAmong the diseases which most commonly afflict these cats are:\nChronic Renal Failure – Also known as simple kidney failure, this hereditary condition is one you will want to guard against by carefully examining the ancestry of any prospective kitten you may be in the market for.\nHyperthyroidism – The general litheness of the breed can be accentuated by hyperthyroidism. This condition forces the body to burn energy it does not necessarily need or want to burn. This in turn causes the already thin cat to be thinner still and makes it harder for them to put or keep weight on their bodies. Medication can control the problem.\nLuxating Patella – In a human, this would be known as a dislocated kneecap. Painful to suffer, painful to force back into its correct position, it is nevertheless not a major worry since a large number of quadrupeds have been known to suffer from this malady at one time or another.\nProgressive Retinal Atrophy – In the long-lived Abyssinian, retinal atrophy first strikes in the form of increasing night blindness. This eventually develops into full-fledged blindness under all conditions. This is a genetic trait of the breed for which there is no cure. The only available prevention is to carefully scrutinize the genealogy of any prospective kitten or cat purchase.\nPyruvate Kinase Deficiency – This is the big one for Abyssinians. Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency is an inheritable red blood cell condition that causes anemia and other blood afflictions. The only known cure is a bone marrow transplant.\nTo be considered a true Abyssinian by breeders, the cat must be colored either ruddy, cinnamon, fawn, or blue.\nBreed Versus Mixed Breed\nTo be a genuine Abyssinian, breeders require that a specimen must be one of four colors.\nRuddy – The first recognized coat color for an Abyssinian is ruddy, which is a combination of reddish-brown with ticks, or small lengths, of black peeking through in places. This ripple of multi-hued fur color along any individual strand is one of the main distinctive features of an Abyssinian. The black is found on the ends of the fur and is most pronounced on the tail and at the lower extremities of the paws. It must also have a fully red nose to qualify.\nCinnamon – More reddish than the brownish Ruddy Abyssinian, and more of an orange-brown in the underneath areas of the coat. All Abyssinians require the darkest hues to be on the tips of the fur. The Cinnamon has Chocolate Brown at the tail tip and feet as well as a darkish pink nose.\nFawn – The lighter-hued Fawn Abyssinian is somewhat evocative of a light Siamese color coat with rose-beige as the primary color and light brown at the ends. Light cocoa brown on the tail tip and feet are matched with a salmon-colored nose.\nBlue – The Blue Abyssinian is not a blue cat but rather one that has a warm beige coat somewhat similar to the Fawn but is tipped with bluish-gray slate highlights rather than brownish ones. Tail and lower paws have the same requirement for predominate dark hues and the nose is a reddish pink.\nVery slight variations of these color schemes are enough to disqualify a cat from being a cat breeder’s standard purebred Abyssinian. Black hair on a red Aby will disqualify. With few exceptions around the face, white patches or spots will disqualify. A dark necklace, or ring that goes entirely around the neck area, will disqualify. There are no recognized crossbreed Abyssinians.\nThere is, however, a separate group called Silver Abyssinians which includes the colors: black silver, blue silver, fawn silver and sorrel silver.\nView all 191 animals that start with A\nAbout the Author\nAbby Parks\nAbby Parks has authored a fiction novel, theatrical plays, short stories, poems, and song lyrics.

There is some question as to whether breeders created it from several UK domestic tabby and shorthair cats, if it was an exotic import brought home from military campaigns in Africa in the 19th Century, or if it happened to be a combination of both.\nIn any event, the original UK breed was nearly annihilated in WWII due to the Luftwaffe bombing and severe restrictions on the domestic economy such as extreme meat rationing. By the end of hostilities, a mere dozen Abyssinians remained, but the numbers were replenished via imports brought back from North American stocks of the breed. The cat is a medium-sized, intelligent, and friendly creature with a distinctive coat. It is not famous for being a lap cat or meowing a lot.\nHow much does an Abyssinian cat cost?\nNon-breedable Abys start for sale at around $500 and the price goes up from there. Sexually intact Abyssinians can start at about $1200 and run up to the high price of $5000 for very pedigreed examples.\nWhat does Abyssinian mean?\nAbyssinian is an adjective that describes someone or something from Abyssinia, which is a region on the eastern horn of Africa and south of Egypt. A pair of exotic cats that were obtained in this area were brought home to England and were thus called Abyssinian cats.\nAre Abyssinian cats mean?\nIn the sense of being aggressive or cruel, the answer is no. Yet they are not fond of being held in the lap and may express displeasure at this violation of Abyssinian etiquette. They are very loving animals but prefer sitting alongside rather than on top of their human friends.\nAre Abyssinian cats cuddly?\nSo far as all domestic cat species are concerned, the answer is probably a qualified no. They love being doted upon and petted but are not big fans of being held tightly. Individuals may of course acquire a taste for such things but they are not notable for appreciating such constricting but well-meant actions.\nAre Abyssinian cats hypoallergenic?\nNo breed of a domestic house cat is 100% hypoallergenic. In most cases, keeping the house clean and the cat brushed will reduce allergens to the point that almost anybody can tolerate the presence of a cat on the premises. Abyssinians are, however, rated as being among the most nearly hypoallergenic cat breeds, particularly female Abyssinians.\nDo Abyssinian cats shed?\nAll cats shed to some degree but the Abyssinian’s peculiarly structured tabby style fur and short hair make them low on the list of shedding cats.\nAre There Any Rescue Abyssinians Available?\nUnlike the average tabby in a distressed home environment, it is not likely that an Abyssinian would be given up for rescue. If it did happen, it would be because it was found as a stray, or perhaps the cat’s owner did not recognize its value before giving it up for rescue. It would be in the interest of both cat and owner to offer it for sale to a genuine Abyssinian fancier.\nThank you for reading! Have some feedback for us?

This may seem funny seeing that it’s a member of the Toy group and only weighs around 10 pounds fully grown. But, in its mind, this dog is a Great Dane ! The history of the Affenpinscher, sometimes called a monkey terrier due to its appearance, goes back to the 17th century. In Germany, they were used to hunt down rats and mice in stables. They could easily get into small spaces to capture these rodents. Eventually, they were brought into people’s homes to serve the same purpose. From there, they became loyal companions for members of the family. This breed is affectionate and good with older kids and adults. They are serious about protecting their family but are also known to clown around giving everyone a laugh.\n3 Pros and Cons of Owning an Affenpinscher\nPros! Cons! Needs minimal exercise. This small pooch only requires 20 to 30 minutes of exercise per day. Sometimes this breed can be difficult to housebreak due to its independent nature. Families who want an alert canine that barks when a stranger comes to the door will be pleased with an Affenpinscher. Though considered hypoallergenic, it’s best to groom this pooch twice a week. This can be time-consuming for an owner. This breed doesn’t need much space, so it’s a good option for a family who lives in an apartment. Affenpinschers were bred to chase down rats and mice. Unfortunately, they aren’t able to distinguish between a pet hamster or gerbil and a field mouse they are supposed to capture.\nAffenpinscher’s are friendly dogs, but they can be yappy!\n©f8grapher/Shutterstock.com\nArticles Mentioning Affenpinscher\n6 Loyal Types of Pinscher Dogs\n15 Best German Dog Breeds With Pictures\n13 Smallest Dog Breeds in the World\nThe Absolute 10 Strangest & Weirdest Dog Breeds in the World!\nWhat Were Shih Tzus Bred For?

Past Role, Jobs, History, and More\n13 Smallest Dog Breeds in the World\nBest Apartment Dogs: The Definitive 9 Picks\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nEvolution and Origins\nAffenpinschers were first bred in the 1600s in Germany to get rid of vermin such as mice and rats some of which were bold enough to scuttle up homeowners’ legs. However, their friendly devoted nature soon saw them become beloved domestic companions, in addition to being natural forms of pest control.\nTheir name comes from the German word “affen” which means monkey or ape, and fully translates to “monkey dog”.\nHealth and Entertainment for your Affenpinscher\nSee all of our expert product reviews .\nIn France, however, they are called  “mustached little devils” ( diablotin moustachu ).\nSize and Weight\nAffenpinschers are small pooches that can grow to be 11.5 inches at the withers. They weigh 10 pounds fully grown. At 7 weeks old, Affenpinschers weigh around 2 pounds. They are considered fully grown at one year old.\nHeight (Male) 11.5 inches tall Height (Female) 11.5 inches tall Weight (Male) 10 pounds, fully grown Weight (Female) 10 pounds, fully grown\nCommon Health Issues\nAffenpinschers have some common health issues that their owner should be aware of. The first one is called patellar luxation. This is a medical term for a dislocated knee. Knee dislocation happens when the pup’s kneecap moves out of place as it’s running or trotting along. Sometimes an Affenpinscher is able to pop it back into place with a certain movement. In other situations, surgery may be needed. Another common health issue is called corneal dystrophy. It’s a genetic condition that occurs when crystals form on the dog’s cornea. These crystals can affect the Affenpinscher’s vision and sometimes surgery is necessary. Hip dysplasia is another common health issue of this breed. This condition occurs when the hip joint moves out of alignment. Hip dysplasia can lead to arthritis in later years. Limping and limited movement are signs of this condition. The most common health issues include:\nPatellar luxation\nCorneal dystrophy\nHip dysplasia\nTemperament\nAffenpinschers are small dogs known for their fearless behavior. They sometimes bark at and try to intimidate big dogs while forgetting about their size disadvantage! This courageous quality makes them great watchdogs for a household. In addition, they have a loyal, affectionate personality. These traits have earned them a good reputation as a family dog. Many owners of Affenpinschers are entertained by the antics of this pet. They have a silly streak meaning they like to frolic, jump around, throw toys in the air, and act goofy. This is one of their most endearing traits.\nHow to Take Care of an Affenpinscher\nGiving the best level of care to an Affenpinscher is easier when an owner knows the unique diet, exercise and healthcare needs of this breed. Whether someone has a puppy or an adult Affenpinscher, making a daily care plan can help to keep this pet healthy and happy.\nThe Best Dog Food for Affenpinschers\nAffenpinscher puppies and adult dogs have different dietary, exercise and healthcare needs. Look at some of the required nutrients in their daily diets. Affenpinscher puppy food: Protein is the main ingredient in any high-quality puppy food for Affenpinschers. The amino acids in protein build strong muscles and tissue. Protein may help to prevent the development of hip dysplasia. A limited amount of fat gives a puppy energy and helps them absorb the vitamins in their food. Calcium and vitamin D support the growth of strong bones which is especially valuable to this breed due to its potential to develop patellar luxation. Vitamin A contributes to this puppy’s eye health. Fiber helps with its proper digestion. Affenpinscher adult dog food: Protein is just as important for adult varieties as it is for puppies. Protein in the form of meat, rice, and potatoes maintains strong muscles and tissue. Vitamin E contributes to skin health and Vitamin A supports a dog’s eye health. This is important in preventing corneal dystrophy in this breed. A limited amount of fat provides energy to this little dog while not adding unnecessary weight.\nAt A-Z Animals, we think one of the best dog foods for full-grown Affenpinschers is Hill’s Science Diet Dry Adult Dog Food .\nThis food has vitamins E, C, D3, and B12, with vitamin A and taurine that Affenpinschers need to maintain healthy eyes, since they tend to develop corneal dystrophy.\nFind Hill’s Science Diet Dry Adult Dog Food on Chewy or Amazon here.\nBest for Adult Dogs\nHill’s Science Diet Sensitive Stomach & Skin\nDesigned specifically for dogs with sensitive stomachs\nChicken and rice base is appetizing and tasty\nGrains like barley, rice and sorghum help bind bowel movements\nContains prebiotic fiber to help for solid stools\nCheck Chewy\nCheck Amazon\nGiving Affenpinscher puppies and adults access to water at all times keeps them hydrated and helps digestion.\nMaintenance and Grooming\nHow much does an Affenpinscher shed? Though this canine is considered to be hypoallergenic, it does shed a little more than average with the change of seasons. Grooming twice a week keeps its medium-long, wire-haired coat in good condition. A sample grooming routine would include brushing the dog with a slicker brush. This removes loose and dead hair. Next, groom with a metal comb featuring both fine and medium teeth, so it reaches into the dog’s coat. Using these two grooming tools on an Affenpinscher’s hair keeps the tangles away and maintains a healthy coat. It’s best to start at the pup’s head and brush toward its tail.\nTraining\nAffenpinschers are relatively easy to train. An owner should keep in mind that these dogs do best with short obedience training sessions. When a training session is short, an Affenpinscher has less opportunity to become bored and distracted. Words of praise and favored treats are very helpful tools when putting this pup through obedience training. It’s a good idea to save a certain kind of favored treat to use only during obedience training sessions. That way, the Affenpinscher knows it’s training time when the treats are given. The Cairn terrier is another smart dog similar to the Affenpinscher that learns better with short obedience training sessions.\nExercise\nThese cute canines need a moderate amount of exercise each day to maintain good health. This means about 20 to 30 minutes of activity. Taking a walk around the neighborhood, walking in the woods, or playing fetch are all good options. These little canines have a short stride, so taking them on a long jog is not a good idea. The dog will be exhausted! As far as apartment living goes, an Affenpinscher is an excellent option. This pet doesn’t need a lot of space to move around in, so an apartment would be a good living environment. This breed is ideal for people who like to take their pooch along everywhere they go! Learn more about the best dogs for apartment living here .\nPuppies\nSince this is a Toy breed, Affenpinscher puppies are especially small. So, owners of these puppies must take extra care to keep them safe while allowing them to explore their environment.\nAffenpinschers make great family pets. They are good with kids and are quite playful.\n©Didkovska Ilona/Shutterstock.com\nChildren\nAffenpinschers are a good option for families with older children. Some younger children and toddlers have a tendency to treat small dogs as toys. An Affenpinscher that’s treated in a rough way by a young child can become nervous and jumpy. Though the child may not mean any harm, an Affenpinscher can become frightened for its own safety and lash out.\nDogs Similar to Affenpinschers\nDogs similar to the Affenpinscher include the Cairn terrier, Norfolk terrier, and the Border terrier.\n• Cairn terrier – Cairn terriers and Affenpinschers are about the same height, but Cairn terriers weigh a little more. They are both alert, energetic dogs that are considered hypoallergenic. • Norfolk terrier – Norfolk terriers have a temperament both feisty and sweet like Affenpinschers. They are approximately the same size, but Norfolk terriers are in the Terrier group, not the toy group. • Border terrier – Border terriers are taller and heavier than Affenpinschers. Both Affenpinschers and Border terriers are intelligent and energetic with a loyal temperament.\nFamous Affenpinschers\nOne of the most famous Affenpinschers goes by the name of Banana Joe. At 4 years old, Banana Joe was the first Affenpinscher to win Best in Show at the Westminster Dog Show in 2013.\nPopular Names for Affenpinschers\nSome popular names for Affenpinschers include:\nDuke\nHarley\nOliver\nCooper\nZeus\nStella\nLulu\nMolly\nCoco\nView all 191 animals that start with A\nWhat's the right dog for you?\nDogs are our best friends but which breed is your perfect match?\nGet Started\nX-Small\nSmall\nMedium\nLarge\nXtra-Large\nNext\nI don't care, I love dogs of all sizes!\nIf you have kids or existing dogs select:\nKids\nOther Dogs\nNext\nSkip\n<< Back\nShould they be Hypoallergenic?\nYes\nNo\nNext\nSkip\n<< Back\nHow important is health?\nNext\nSkip\n<< Back\nWhich dog groups do you like?\nSporting\nHound\nWorking\nTerrier\nToy\nNon-sporting\nHerding\nNext\nDoesn't Matter\n<< Back\nHow much exercise should your dog require?\nLow\nModerate\nHigh\nNext\nDoesn't Matter\n<< Back\nWhat climate?\nWarm climate\nCold climate\nAverage climate\nNext\nDoesn't Matter\n<< Back\nHow much seperation anxiety?\nLow\nModerate\nHigh\nNext\nDoesn't Matter\n<< Back\nHow much yappiness/barking?\nSilent\nLow\nModerate\nHigh\nNext\nDoesn't Matter\n<< Back\nHow much energy should they have?\nThe lower energy the better.

Though they are easily found in rescue shelters, breeders will also sell them to make a profit from their long yet silky hair. Originally bred as hunting dogs, these dogs are strong and independent, requiring plenty of exercise to keep healthy and mentally occupied. They tend to be on their feet constantly, showing off their hair. However, some owners keep them shaved or short-haired to help them cool off in warmer environments.\nSee all of our expert product reviews .\n©A-Z-Animals.com\n3 Pros and Cons of Owning Afghan Hounds\nTo understand the advantages and disadvantages of adopting an Afghan Hound (especially considering the high price of the breed), this list provides an unbiased look. All of these factors should be considered when deciding if this breed is the right animal for the household. Here are a few pros and cons of the breed:\nPros! Cons! Warm personalities : These dogs are social and loving with the members of their human family, making them a sweet family pet. Needs a lot of space : These dogs usually do not stay comfortable in small spaces and need a spacious area to let their energy out. Energetic : If you are looking for a dog breed that is energetic and pushes you to get out of the house, this is the right pup. With a constant desire to exercise, they are a great jogging companion. Strong chase instinct: These dogs have very strong chase instincts, which may not be best for small animals or especially excitable children. Minimal shedding : If you are someone who is looking for a minimal mess and brushing, these dogs shed surprisingly little for having such a long coat. High-maintenance grooming : Even though they do not shed a lot, it takes a lot of time to groom these dogs because of their long, silky hair. This issue can be remedied by keeping the puppy shaved or short-haired, which some owners will do to keep their dogs cool when the weather gets warmer.\nAfghan Hound\n©Hagon1 / Creative Commons\nArticles Mentioning Afghan Hound\nAre Mini Goldendoodle Hypoallergenic?\nWhat Kind Of Dog Is Tank on FBI International?

Its exact origin in the vast area of Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan is unknown. However, it has been used as a hunting and status symbol for centuries. These sighthound dogs are able to locate their prey using their excellent vision and swift speed.\nSince ancient times, the Afghan hound has been a part of Eastern culture. It was not until the late 1800s, when officers from the British Empire brought the breed to Europe, that it was recognized on a Western level. By the early 1900s, the Afghan hound had become a favorite of the British elite.\nHealth and Entertainment for your Afghan Hound\nSee all of our expert product reviews .\nThe American Kennel Club first registered an Afghan Hound in 1927, but it wasn’t until the early 1930s that the breed started to become popular in the United States. One of the most important dogs of this time period was a breeding pair imported from England by Zeppo Marx, the youngest Marx Brother. The Afghan Hound has become known for its presence in shows and as a pet. A giant sculpture of an Afghan Hound named Kabul was created by Pablo Picasso in Chicago’s Daley Plaza.\nAfghan hounds are thought to be the oldest purebred dog.\n©Ltshears / Creative Commons\nSize and Weight\nWith long and beautiful hair, these dogs have a slim but athletic physique. Female Afghan hounds are usually about 25 inches tall, though the males stand a little taller at 27 inches. Meanwhile, both female and male varieties weigh about 50 to 60 pounds.\nLearn more about the best big dog breeds here .\nHeight (Male): 27 inches tall Height (Female): 25 inches tall Weight (male): 50 to 60 lbs., fully grown Weight (female): 50 to 60 lbs., fully grown\nAn Afghan Hound usually weighs between 50-60 pounds.\n©Esparta / Creative Commons\nCommon Health Issues\nThe beautiful appearance of the Afghan hound can be deceiving, as the breed comes with multiple health concerns that will require regular veterinary care to prevent and treat them.\nTheir long legs and tall build put them at significant risk of hip and elbow dysplasia, evidenced by the misalignment of the bones in the joints that hold them. Issues often arise in the thyroid gland, which regulates various metabolic processes.\nJuvenile cataracts can be another concern for this dog breed. These cataracts cloud the eye, preventing the dog from seeing clearly, eventually leading to blindness.\nLaryngeal paralysis is common in these dogs. This paralysis makes breathing difficult, though the condition is treatable. Unfortunately, before the treatment begins, it is unclear if the animal will still have a good quality of life.\nOne of the diseases that this breed can permanently face is Von Willebrand disease. The condition prevents the blood from clotting since the animal would lack certain proteins that are supposed to manage the clotting. Though the trait is ingrained in the DNA, not all Afghan’s develop it.\nThe health issues that these dogs face will often depend on their breeding, which can be checked against the pedigree database. Overall, some of the common health issues relating to this dog breed include:\nHip dysplasia\nElbow dysplasia\nJuvenile cataracts\nThyroid problems\nLaryngeal paralysis\nVon Willebrand disease\nAfghan Hounds are prone to hip and elbow dysplasia.\n©Sannse / Creative Commons\nTemperament\nAfghan hounds are very content and easy-going in temperament, though they are always up and running. Due to their natural hunting desire, their intelligence is well-suited for outdoor activities that require endurance or energy. They also tend to be strong-willed and aloof.\nWhile it is usually common for them to stay distant from strangers, they are very warm towards their human families. They can sometimes be timid with new experiences and people but are generally very brave, making them a good breed for protecting the home.\nTo ensure that these dogs become acclimated to other breeds, they need to be introduced to a social circle from early on.\nAfghan Hounds are easy-going dogs.\n©Hagon1 / Creative Commons\nHow to Take Care of Afghan Hounds\nBefore you finalize your decision to adopt the Afghan Hound from a rescue or a breeder, you need to understand the amount of care that goes into them. This breed has many grooming needs, and they need to be fed regularly to thrive and grow. Here are some things that you should know about taking good care of these dogs:\nThe Best Dog Food\nAfghan dogs do well with a high-quality protein-based diet. Split the dog food into two meals, totaling approximately 2-2.5 cups of high-quality dog food a day (like Pedigree) to keep your pet satisfied. Some of the human foods these dogs enjoy include chicken and sweet potatoes. However, the food and nutrition requirements of the Afghan hound puppies are different from those of adult varities, as they need more protein in their growth years.\nWith the pronounced risk of hip and elbow dysplasia that accompanies Afghan Hounds’ lanky frame, adding glucosamine to this dog’s diet is a good plan. Hypothyroidism is another serious concern, and this condition has an association with laryngeal paralysis. Feeding Afghan Hounds an organic diet could help mitigate endocrine (hormonal) disruptions linked to hypothyroidism and laryngeal paralysis.\nThat’s why A-Z Animals recommends Castor & Pollux Organix Grain-Free Dry Organic Dog Food for Afghan Hounds.\nThough it’s intended for senior dogs, this recipe is ideal for Afghan hounds’ joints and endocrine systems. The chondroitin and glucosamine reinforce their hips and elbows to keep them mobile as they go through life. And the healthy, certified organic ingredients sans artificial flavors, preservatives, or colors, antibiotics, or added growth hormones may protect your Afghan Hound from endocrine problems.\nCheck Chewy and Amazon for these products.\nCastor and Pollux Organix Grain-Free Dry Food\nMade with organic, free-range chicken as the first ingredient accompanied by organic sweet potatoes.\nUSDA organic certified chicken dog food containing no artificial preservatives, flavors or colors\nOrganic flaxseed, blueberries and sweet potatoes provide extra nutrition and health benefits in a mouthwatering meal.\nOrganix provides complete and balanced organic diets for your faithful and precious pooch.\nOrganic dog food made without corn, wheat, soy, chickpeas or lentils.\nCheck Chewy\nCheck Amazon\nMaintenance and Grooming\nAfghan hounds do not shed much, but brushing through their long hair takes a while, so account for the extra time during their grooming session. These sessions should include regular bathing to prevent dander and to keep their fur glossy.\nBrush through the hair while it is still moist, using a grooming spray to prevent painful tangles. Often, these dogs require some type of oil to nourish the fur. In the same session, owners should keep their pet’s nails trimmed.\nIf you want to spend less time on their hair, they need to keep their pet short-haired.\nTraining\nWhen it comes to training, the strong-willed nature of the Afghan hounds makes them quite stubborn. A firm but positive tone is necessary to convey authority, though owners may still have a hard time with training. They are not known to be obedient and often do not respond to training tricks.\nAfghan Hounds can be tricky to train due to their strong will and stubborn nature.\n©Lilly M / Creative Commons\nExercise\nAfghan hounds are highly energetic dogs, which means that they need to have regular exercise to keep them happy. Optimally, make sure that your dog gets at least two hours of exercise every day for it to remain fit and healthy.\nThey would need a lot of space to run around. Physical activity is known to positively impact these dogs, helping them to maintain their good behavior.\nPuppies\nAn Afghan hound puppy needs to be taken care of in a similar way as you would take care of an adult variety. However, they will need to have more protein in their diet than adults, helping them to grow into athletic and strong adults. To ensure that the food is not overwhelming, break their meals into several small meals.\nAfghan hounds are high-energy dogs and need a minimum of 2 hours of exercise per day.\n©otsphoto/Shutterstock.com\nWith Children\nAfghan hounds are great with children. They are playful, and their energy often makes them compatible to be the perfect playmates with the children. It is said that the best would be to let your puppy grow old with your children to increase as well as maintain their compatibility. However, Afghan hounds usually have low pain tolerance which could sometimes be a problem with children in the long run.\nAfghan Hounds love to play but need time after they eat before exercising.\n©Maria Ivanushkina/Shutterstock.com\nDogs Similar to Afghan Hound\nThough it is easy to see the history of the Afghan hound on a pedigree database, some pet owners may want an alternative breed that would work for them. Here are some dogs that are similar to the Afghan: Basenji : These dogs were also originally bred for hunting purposes. They are energetic and affectionate and are often known as barkless dogs. Bloodhound : These dogs were originated in France and were used for hunting purposes. They are now also used for tracking people down. Greyhound : These dogs are known to be the fastest dog breed. They are racers and make sweet and calm pets, especially when they are old.\nFamous Afghan Hounds\nPablo Picasso famously adopted an Afghan Hound named Kabul, including him in many famous paintings to show his admiration. These animals are often featured in dog shows, allowing their elegance to be admired. Among the many famous celebrities who have brought this dog into their families are Salvador Dali and Marianne Faithfull.\nAfghan Hound puppies love to play but have a low pain tolerance. They cannot run for long periods of time without needing a break.\n©otsphoto/Shutterstock.com\nPopular Names for Afghan Hounds\nHere are some of the popular names for the Afghan hound dogs:\nPrince\nMarques\nNicholas\nPrincess\nLeopold\nView all 191 animals that start with A\nWhat's the right dog for you?\nDogs are our best friends but which breed is your perfect match?\nGet Started\nX-Small\nSmall\nMedium\nLarge\nXtra-Large\nNext\nI don't care, I love dogs of all sizes!\nIf you have kids or existing dogs select:\nKids\nOther Dogs\nNext\nSkip\n<< Back\nShould they be Hypoallergenic?\nYes\nNo\nNext\nSkip\n<< Back\nHow important is health?\nNext\nSkip\n<< Back\nWhich dog groups do you like?\nSporting\nHound\nWorking\nTerrier\nToy\nNon-sporting\nHerding\nNext\nDoesn't Matter\n<< Back\nHow much exercise should your dog require?\nLow\nModerate\nHigh\nNext\nDoesn't Matter\n<< Back\nWhat climate?\nWarm climate\nCold climate\nAverage climate\nNext\nDoesn't Matter\n<< Back\nHow much seperation anxiety?\nLow\nModerate\nHigh\nNext\nDoesn't Matter\n<< Back\nHow much yappiness/barking?\nSilent\nLow\nModerate\nHigh\nNext\nDoesn't Matter\n<< Back\nHow much energy should they have?\nThe lower energy the better.

Caught from Alaska to northern Japan every year, this fish species is the world’s second most important total catch after Peruvian anchoveta (a type of anchovy ) and U.S. landings are the largest of any single fish species there. It’s the most commonly eaten wild-caught whitefish in the world and the third most commonly eaten fish in the United States .\n5 Alaskan Pollock Facts\nIt is caught wild in Alaska .\nFishing Alaskan pollock fuels the Washington economy and the North Pacific Fishing Fleet.\nWild populations are sustainably harvested and responsibly managed.\nIt is one of the top 20 healthiest foods in the world, being a great source of protein, vitamin B12, and omega-3 essential fatty acids.\nDelicious, versatile, and popular, it is used in many different recipes including fish and chips, fish sandwiches, fish tacos, imitation crab, and pollock roe sandwich spread.\nAlaskan Pollock Classification and Scientific Name\nThis fish species is a member of the class Actinopterygii, which is the ray-finned fishes. It is a member of the order Gadiformes, and the family Gadidae of the true codfishes, which includes cod , haddock , pollock, and whiting, with 12 genera. It is in the cod genus Gadus, of which there are four genera. Common names are walleye and walleye pollock, while alternate names snow cod, bigeye cod, copperline cod, and lesser cod. The scientific name Gadus chalcogrammus comes from the Latin word gadus meaning “cod” (from the Greek khalkós meaning “copper”) and the Greek word grammí meaning “line.”\nThis fish’s scientific name used to be Theragra chalcogramma. There is one species of Alaskan pollock. Norwegian pollock (Theragra finnmarchica) is believed to be the same species as the Alaska pollock, differing only in its geography.\nAlaskan Pollock Appearance\nOn average, Alaskan pollock measures 12-20in long and weighs 1-3lbs, but can reach 3ft in length. Its body is slender and resembles that of cod and haddock . Black and yellow spots serve as camouflage to avoid predators on the ocean floor.\nAlaskan pollock vs. Pacific cod\nThis fish is closely related to Pacific\ncod and so they are often confused for each other. However, the main difference is that its chin barbel is either very small or entirely absent. It also has more pronounced fins, a narrower tail, shorter lifespan, and earlier sexual maturity. Their habitats overlap in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska , but cod also live in northern California waters and the Sea of Japan , both of which are slightly warmer. Alaskan pollock meat is flakier, more tender, and can lose its shape quickly when overcooked.\nArticles Mentioning Alaskan Pollock\nThe Longest Tunnel in Alaska Goes Straight Through a Majestic Snowcapped Mountain\nWhat Do Copepods Eat?\nTilapia vs Haddock: What Are The Differences?\nHaddock vs Alaska Pollock: The Key Differences\nThe 4 Best Fish to Catch in Alaska This Summer\n10 Incredible Blue Shark Facts\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nArticles Mentioning Alaskan Pollock\n10 Incredible Blue Shark Facts\nThe 4 Best Fish to Catch in Alaska This Summer\nWhat Do Copepods Eat?\nHaddock vs Alaska Pollock: The Key Differences\nTilapia vs Haddock: What Are The Differences?\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nAlaskan pollock vs. haddock\nAlaskan pollock is also related to haddock and they may be confused for each other. However, pollock has a greenish tint and a white lateral line, firmer flake, and stronger flavor, whereas haddock has black lateral line, black thumbprint on its side, finer flake, and milder flavor. Their habitats are also different, with haddock living in the north Atlantic .\nAlaskan Pollock Distribution, Population, and Habitat\nThe Alaskan pollock’s primary habitats are the coastal areas of the Northern Pacific , Alaska , Russia , Korea , and Japan . It lives in Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands, Eastern Bering Sea, Western Bering Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk. However, its main populations are most concentrated in the eastern Bering Sea.\nThe waters this fish lives in are marine and brackish, with a depth range of up to 1,280m. It lives at the benthopelagic level, being on or near the sea bottom, mid-water and near-surface depths, and is non-migratory, although it moves vertically in search of food. This fish’s population is above target levels according to the NOAA. Its conservation status is listed as Near Threatened according to the IUCN Red List .\nWhere to find Alaskan pollock and how to catch it\nThis fish is usually 30-400m deep. You can find it in the north Pacific waters off Alaska , California , and the Sea of Japan . During the spring, you will find pollock has migrated inshore to shallow water to feed and breed, and in deeper, warmer waters in the winter months. It is during the fall where they are near the bottom of the ocean floor. However, it is usually caught at 50-300m deep. The typical fishing method is trawling. Bait that works best are sand eels and imitation minnows with lures between 15-25cm long.\nAlaskan Pollock Predators and Prey\nThe Alaskan pollock has a carnivorous diet. It is a forager and will even eat other pollock. During the winter, the larger pollock don’t need to forage because they can better store energy and will consume more calories during the fall to prepare for it, while their smaller counterparts work on getting larger in size.\nWhat does Alaskan pollock eat?\nThe juvenile Alaskan pollock eats zooplankton and small fish. The adult fish eats other fish , juvenile pollock, copepods and krill , which are two types of small crustaceans .\nWhat eats Alaskan pollock?\nOther fish , sea lions and sea birds are two of several predators that eat Alaskan pollock. Humans also eat Alaskan pollock.\nAlaskan Pollock Reproduction and Lifespan\nThis fish reproduces by spawning and gives birth to eggs. It breeds ever year. The incubation time depends on temperature, with the period being 10 days at 10 days and up to 27.4 days at 2°C. The larvae are 3.4-4.4m long when hatched and float upside-down at the water surface, absorbing their yolk sacs once they reach 7-7.5mm or 22 days at 2°C.The juvenile (young) pollock are sexually mature at 3-4 years. This fish has a lifespan of 12 years and maximum lifespan of 28 years.\nAlaskan Pollock in Fishing and Cooking\nThis fish has tender, flaky, mild, white meat with a low oil content. Its nutrition content is low in fat, high in protein, vitamin B12, and omega-3 essential fatty acids. It’s also mercury safe compared to other wild fish because it is harvested in the remote, clean waters of Alaska. Common Alaskan pollock recipes people purchase at stores or at fast-food restaurants are frozen breaded and battered fillets or fillet sandwiches and fresh surimi, including imitation crab, although like other fish, it is best eaten freshly prepared at home or at a restaurant. In Russia, people commonly enjoy it as pollock roe sandwich spread, which is just one of several possible recipes.t can be baked, poached, grilled, deep-fried, or pan-fried.\nSome popular Alaskan pollock recipes showcasing the versatility of this fish are:\nBaked pollock\nBeer-battered pollock bites\nCrispy Pan-fried Alaskan pollock with garlic mashed potatoes and tartar sauce\nAlaska pollock jerk tacos\nView all 191 animals that start with A\nAbout the Author\nAustin S.\nGrowing up in rural New England on a small scale farm gave me a lifelong passion for animals.

Alligators tend to be smaller than their Crocodile cousins but have been known to move at speeds of up to 15mph on land making them one of the fastest large reptiles in the world. Despite their size, there are a number of distinct differences between Alligators and Crocodiles as an Alligator’s snout is shorter than that of a Crocodile, and with their mouths shut, an Alligator’s teeth cannot be seen but a Crocodile’s can. Alligators are also commonly known as Gators in their native, southern North American habitats.\nAnatomy and Appearance\nAlligators’ short stocky legs and webbed feet enable them to navigate muddy areas with ease\n©Jim Schwabel/Shutterstock.com\nAlligators are very large reptiles , with males growing up to 4.5 meters in length. The female Alligator tends to be slightly smaller, with a total body and tail length of between 3 and 3.5 meters. The Chinese Alligator is a much smaller species, almost half the size of a female American Alligator. Alligators have an armour-plated body that varies in color from yellow to green, to brown, finally turning almost completely black in old age. The tail of the Alligator is incredibly muscular and is used to propel the animal when it is in the water. Alligators have short, stocky legs with webbing between their toes. This not only helps them when they are swimming but also means that they can negotiate muddy river banks with ease.\nAlligators have multiple stomachs. The first part of their stomach contains stones to grind up food, while the second part is extremely acidic and aids in digestion.\nArticles Mentioning American Alligator\nDiscover the 7 Most Dangerous Florida Beaches to Be Wary of This Spring Break\nWatch a Daring Couple Capture a 9-Foot Alligator and Load It in Their Honda Civic\nDiscover the Deepest Lake in Harris County\nDiscover the 7 Most Dangerous Animals Lurking in Texas’s Lakes and Rivers\nThe Longest Tunnel in California Is a Picturesque Modern Miracle\nAlligators in San Antonio: Are You Safe to Go in the Water?\nSee How a Massive Alligator Invaded a Texas Highway and Shocked Commuters\nWatch a Fearless Policeman Turn Into a Cowboy and Lasso a Hissing Alligator\nDiscover the Rainiest Place in Louisiana\nDiscover the 10 Most Dangerous Animals Lurking in Florida’s Lakes and Marshes\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nArticles Mentioning American Alligator\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nAlligator vs. Crocodile: 6 Key Differences and Who Wins in a Fight\nThe 10 Strongest Animal Bite Forces in the World\nThe 10 Most Alligator Infested Lakes in the United States\nHuge Florida Gator Eats a Smaller Florida Gator in Most Florida Video Ever\nTop 8 Largest Crocodiles Ever\nThe 10 Most Stunning Apex Predators from Around the World\nWatch an Indigo Snake Consume a Python Whole\nCan Crocodiles and Alligators Mate?\nThe Top 4 Most Alligator-Infested Lakes In Texas\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nDistribution and Habitat\nAmerican alligators prefer freshwater and brackish environments\n©Danita Delimont/Shutterstock.com\nAmerican Alligators are found in the south-eastern USA, throughout all of Florida and Louisiana, the southern parts of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, coastal South and North Carolina, eastern Texas, the south-eastern corner of Oklahoma, and the southern tip of Arkansas. The majority of American Alligators inhabit Florida and Louisiana, with over a million alligators thought to be found between the two states. American Alligators live in freshwater environments, such as ponds, marshes, wetlands, rivers, lakes, and swamps, as well as brackish environments. Southern Florida is the only place in the world where both Alligators and Crocodiles are known to live in the same place.\nPopulation By State\nThe population of American Alligators by state is estimated to be:\nLouisiana: 2 million\nFlorida: 1.3 million\nTexas: 400,000 to 500,000\nGeorgia: 200,000 to 250,000\nSouth Carolina: 100,000\nAlabama: 70,000\nMississippi: 32,000 to 38,000\nArkansas: 2,000 to 3,000\nNorth Carolina: 1,000\nOklahoma: 100 to 200\nBehavior and Lifestyle\nAmerican Alligators are clumsy on land\n©Matthew Field / Creative Commons\nThe Alligator is a solitary predator that is actually surprisingly clunky when moving about on land. They tend to be quite slow, moving by either crawling or sliding along the slippery banks on their bellies. They are highly territorial animals that are known to make a variety of noises to represent different things, including the declaration of territory, finding a mate, or the young warning their mother that they are in danger. Male alligators however do not appear to have such a prominent voice box and make very little noise outside of the breeding season, when they are known to growl and bellow to fend off competing males.\nReproduction and Life Cycles\nBaby alligators hatch after an incubation period of 2 months\n©iStock.com/Casanowe\nAlligators tend to breed during the spring when they come together in large groups to find a suitable partner. The female constructs a nest out of mud, leaves, and twigs on the ground where she lays up to 50 eggs. The hatchlings emerge after a 2-month incubation period which occurs in the nest’s rotting vegetation. Females do not incubate their eggs as they would break them but still guard their nest from hungry predators. The baby Alligators are between 15 and 20 long when they hatch and are vulnerable to predation from a number of species. They usually remain with their mother for the first 2 years. Alligators tend to live to about 50 years old or so but some have been known to live at least another 20 years when in captivity.\nTo know more about the alligator mating season, read here .\nDiet and Prey\nAlligators enjoy a varied diet which consists of birds, fish, and small mammals\n©iStock.com/Nigel Stripe\nThe Alligator is generally a solitary predator, but smaller and younger individuals however are known to stay together in groups especially when hunting. The reptile eats fish, small mammals and birds, but has also been known to attack much larger animals. Adult alligators have been known to hunt Deer and are well known to kill and eat smaller Alligators. In some cases, larger individuals have been known to hunt the Florida Panther and Black Bears, making the alligator the dominant predator throughout their environment. Attacks on pets and even people are also not unknown.\nRead here to know about the alligator’s death roll .\nPredators and Threats\nBobcats are partial to tender, succulent alligator hatchlings\n©Victor Arita/Shutterstock.com\nThe Alligator is an apex predator in its environment, known to even hunt animals that are much larger in size. Humans are the only predator of adult Alligators as they were hunted almost to extinction for their meat, and for their unique skin which was used in the manufacture of a variety of products. The smaller, baby Alligators however, are prey to a number of species including Raccoons, Birds, Bobcats , and even other Alligators. Despite being protected from hunting in much of its North American range today, Alligators are threatened by the loss of their natural habitats and high levels of pollution in the water.\nInteresting Facts and Features\nAlligator DNA is thought to date back to even before Dinosaur times meaning that the Alligators survived whatever it was that the dinosaurs didn’t, with the scientific estimates first dating the species 150 million years ago. The Chinese Alligator is currently found only in the Yangtze River Valley and the Chinese Alligator is now extremely endangered with less than 100 Chinese Alligators believed to be left in the wild. There are actually many more Chinese Alligators that live in zoos around the world than can be found in the wild today. Alligators are known to have up to 80 teeth which are perfectly shaped for biting down on prey. They are even able to regrow those teeth that are lost.\nHow do you tell the differences separating alligators vs. crocodiles ? In general, alligators have a ‘U-shaped’ snout while crocodiles’ snouts are a ‘V-shape.’ In addition, alligators have webbed feet while crocodile feet are not webbed. Finally, alligators are normally a darker color.\nRelationship with Humans\nAlligators love to sneak up on pets and will lash out at humans who get to close for comfort\n©iStock.com/CoinUp\nUnlike large Crocodiles, Alligators do not immediately regard a Human upon encounter as prey, but the Alligator may still attack in self-defence if provoked. Alligator attacks are uncommon but they have definitely been known to attack Humans if they infringe on the reptile’s territory and particularly if the animal feels threatened. They are however known to commonly prey on domestic animals including pets and sometimes livestock when they are close to Human settlements. Hunting towards the end of the last century almost completely obliterated the entire American Alligator population (and has pretty much done so to the Chinese Alligator). Fortunately the gravity of the situation in the USA was realized before it was too late, with the protection of the species having led to an increase in population numbers now.\nConservation Status and Life Today\nThe American Alligator was once an Endangered species but thanks to habitat protection and federal laws protecting them, populations throughout Florida and Louisiana have recovered really well, with over four million Alligators thought to exist in the USA today. They are however now threatened by habitat degradation, mainly in the form of deforestation and pollution in the water. The story of the Chinese Alligator however is very different, with less than 100 individuals thought to be left in the Yangtze River Valley, this species is Critically Endangered in the wild and is sadly on the verge of extinction.\nMore Articles on Alligators\nRead about:\nhistory’s greatest shark vs alligator battle .\nView all 191 animals that start with A\nAbout the Author\nDana Mayor\nI love good books and the occasional cartoon.

American crocodiles far outweigh American alligators, and they are found in both fresh and saltwater, while American alligators prefer fresh water only.\nWho would win a fight between a king cobra and an alligator?\nAn alligator would win a fight against a king cobra.\nBoth animals are ambush predators, so the alligator could wait for the king cobra to come to get a drink of water before attacking and killing it. Likewise, the king cobra could wait in tall grass and bite the alligator, but it’s not fast enough to escape the fight and let the gator die off. The gator would turn on its afterburners and bite the snake.\nWho would win a fight between a rattlesnake and an alligator?\nAn alligator would win the fight against a rattlesnake.\nAlligators have the advantages over rattlesnakes in size, speed, and defense. Their protective body coating would make it exceptionally difficult for a rattlesnake to deliver the venom it would need to inject to win the fight. Alligators’ oversized form and capacity for speed would be strong factors in defeating these venomous serpents. They’ve been known to consume venomous pit vipers like rattlesnakes, apparently resistant to any ill effects of their venom.\nWho would win a fight between a hippo and an alligator?\nA hippo would win a fight against an alligator.\nSimply put, alligators don’t have the toolkit to bring down and kill something as large as a hippo. Even if the average alligator ambushed a hippo and tried to perform a death roll, it’s not going to get much for its effort. The hippo is too thickly built and heavy.\nWho would win a fight between a tiger and an alligator?\nA tiger would win a fight against an alligator.\nHowever, this ruling comes with a few caveats. If a hungry tiger decides to attack an alligator on land, the alligator would have no chance.\n \nWho would win a fight between an anaconda and an alligator?\nAn alligator would win a fight against an anaconda.\nAlthough anacondas are large, effective ambush predators, they would have to perform an incredible ambush at the alligator’s head to disable it to such an extent that it could not fight back and kill it.\nWho would win a fight between a grizzly bear and an alligator?\nA grizzly bear would win a fight against an alligator.\nAlthough the alligator has a very powerful bite, it cannot match the grizzly bear for sheer power. The best-case scenario for the alligator is that it ambushes the grizzly bear on land. Even in that case, the alligator might bite a leg, but it would catch a swift, smashing paw to the head that has enough power to knock it unconscious.\nWho would win a fight between a giant boa and an alligator?\nAn alligator would win a fight against a giant boa.\nMost of the fights in the wild are decided by size or the presence of a particularly deadly attack, like venom. In this case, the boa is much smaller than the alligator and has to wrap its body around the reptile to kill it.\nWhat are some extinct alligators?\nThe largest extinct relative of alligators was Deinosuchus. This massive alligator reached about 39 feet in length and had a bite force that’s estimated at up to twice the force of a Tyrannosaurus Rex!\nWhat are the differences between a Nile crocodile and an alligator?\nThe biggest differences between a Nile crocodile and an alligator include their size, morphology, and habitats.\nWhat are the differences between an American crocodile and a Nile crocodile?\nThe greatest differences between an American crocodile and a Nile crocodile are their size, colors, and location.

Baby crocs can emit a high-pitched scream when in distress.\nCrocodiles can live up to three years without eating.\n©A-Z-Animals.com\nCrocodiles are one of the most well-known and fearsome animals in the world and are considered apex predators . Their powerful bodies, strong jaws, and immense speed and agility along with their unparalleled stealth, have led to them being one of the world’s top predators in their natural environments.\nTypes\nSaltwater crocodile ( Crocodylus porosus ): Once endangered, this marine monster has since staged an impressive comeback. Known for a penchant for ambushing its prey, it is capable of growing to 20 feet in length and weighing over 4,000 pounds. It is also the largest reptile on the planet and generally has dark green scales, although they may also be tan, or almost black in some cases. The giant reptile can be found in Australia, India, and Micronesia.\nNile crocodile ( Crocodylus niloticus ): This reptile is known for its extreme aggression and thick scaly skin. It also has a remarkable ability to clamp down powerfully with its jaws for lengthy periods of time. Its favorite hangouts include lakes, rivers, and swamps and it can generally be found in African regions south of the Sahara and parts of Madagascar.\nAmerican crocodile ( Crocodylus acutus ): The only crocodile apart from the saltwater crocodile to have an affinity for saltwater, this species can be found in Florida, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela.\nHall’s New Guinea crocodile ( Crocodylus halli ): The giant reptiles can be found in the southern part of New Guinea where they prowl in estuaries, lakes, and rivers.\nOrinoco crocodile ( Crocodylus intermedius ): The largest reptile in the Americas, this crocodilian is known for its pale hide and occupies the Orinoco river Basin in Colombia and Venezuela.\nFreshwater crocodile ( Crocodylus johnstoni ): Unlike their saltwater cousins, these reptiles thrive in freshwater and only reach 3 metres and 220 pounds at the maximum. They do live side by side with salties,  although they’re no match for the former.\nPhilippine crocodile ( Crocodylus mindorensis ): These freshwater crocodiles have golden brown scales that darken with age. They play a key role in maintaining healthy fish stocks in their environs and can grow slightly over 8 feet while weighing a maximum of 200 pounds.\nMorelet’s crocodile ( Crocodylus moreletii ): These reptiles which have webbed posterior feet are rather fast runners. They are recognizable by their dark scales and broad snouts.\nNew Guinea crocodile ( Crocodylus novaeguineae ): A separate species from the crocodiles which lie south of the island’s central rige, these reptiles which are found in the north are nocturnal. They have a tapered snout and grey scales.\n Mugger crocodile ( Crocodylus palustris ): Known for its light olive coloring, this crocodile can be found in  India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. It also has a habit of burrowing into the mud to escape scorching temperatures and is the crocodile with the widest snout.\nBorneo crocodile (Crocodylus raninus ): Found in Borneo, as its name suggests, this species continues to remain something of a mystery to experts.\nCuban crocodile ( Crocodylus rhombifer ): Highly intelligent, long-limbed, and fond of land, this crocodile cooperates with other members of its species when hunting. Its numbers, however, have plummeted owing to hunting.\nSiamese crocodile ( Crocodylus siamensis ): This species comes with scales ranging from dark to pale green. It is capable of growing to a maximum of 13 feet and 770 pounds.\nWest African crocodile ( Crocodylus suchus ): With scales which range from dark to pale, this crocodile is known for being fond of fresh water in forests. However, it has also adapted to deserts in Mauritania where it sits out periods of drought ensconced in caves.\nOsborn’s dwarf crocodile ( Osteolaemus osborni ): This species can be found in the Congo river basin in central Africa.\nDwarf crocodile ( Osteolaemus tetraspis ): The smallest crocodile species, this reptile grows to about 5 feet and 70 pounds, and can be found in forests or caves.\nWest African slender-snouted crocodile ( Mecistops cataphractus ): Something of an enigma to experts, this reptile is recognizable by its pointed snout. It also prefers to live in water filed with plant life.\nCentral African slender-snouted crocodile ( Mecistops leptorhynchus ): As its name suggests, this second member of the genus Mecistops, can be found throughout Central Africa. However, it can also be found in Southern Sudan.\nEvolution\nCrocodiles are closely related to other crocodilians including alligators, caimans, and gharials, crocodiles have changed very little in an evolutionary sense in 200 million years.\nUnlike other reptile species, crocodilians are archosaurs which is an ancient group of reptiles that also included dinosaurs.\nAlthough dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago, crocodiles are thought to have survived so well over time due to the fact that they are so well suited to their environments.\nThere are currently 13 different crocodile species that are found inhabiting both fresh and saltwater environments throughout North and South America, Africa , Asia and Australia.\nThe semi-aquatic nature of Crocodiles has led to them evolving a number of key adaptations that allow them to survive so successfully in their natural environments.\nRead here to learn more about prehistoric crocodiles .\nA crocodile rests on rocks and gathers some sunlight.\n©Milan Zygmunt/Shutterstock.com\nEtymology\nThe word crocodile actually originates from the Ancient Greek word krokódilos or some other slight variation. Latinization of the name turned the “k” into a “c”. Some scholars believe that crocodile is a combination of the word for pebbles (krokè ) and for worm ( drilos ).\nArticles Mentioning Crocodile\nWatch This Valiant Zebra Win the Lottery and Somehow Escape a Ruthless Crocodile\nSee How a Massive Alligator Invaded a Texas Highway and Shocked Commuters\nHungry Crocodile vs. Fearless Mountain Lion: Who Wins in a Battle Between the Two?\nWatch This Frisky Impala Turn Into an Olympian and Nail an Insane Long Jump\nAmazing Video Captures an Alligator Invading a Lacrosse Field Mid-Practice\nFlorida vs. Louisiana: Which State Is More Alligator-Infested?\nDiscover Who Emerges Victorious in an Epic Rhino vs. Lion Battle\nWatch This Crocodile Appear Out of Nowhere and Attack a Swimming Lioness\nWatch a Determined Wildebeest Win a ‘Tug of War’ Battle Against a Crocodile Biting Its Tail\nWatch This Covert Crocodile Breach the Water and Attack Swooping Bats\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nArticles Mentioning Crocodile\nThe 10 Largest Lizards in the World\nThe Largest King Cobra in the World\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nAlligator vs. Crocodile: 6 Key Differences and Who Wins in a Fight\nThe 10 Strongest Animal Bite Forces in the World\nThe 10 Absolute Strongest Animals on Earth: Pure Force\nThe Top 10 Deadliest Animals in the World\nThe 10 Most Friendly (Best) Wild Animals in the World\nThe 10 Most Alligator Infested Lakes in the United States\nAre Komodo Dragons Poisonous or Dangerous?\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nAnatomy and Appearance\nCrocodiles are large-sized reptiles with thick, scaly skin that is made up of armored, waterproof plates that both protects them from potential predators and also prevents their bodies from drying out.\nThese scales come in a variety of colors from dull olive and green, to brown, greys and black meaning that they are very easily camouflaged in the surrounding water and vegetation.\nLike other crocodilian species, their eyes and nostrils are located on the very top of their broad head and snout.\nThis is useful as they lie in wait in the water with almost none of their bodies exposed in order to more successfully ambush prey.\nIn order to protect them in the water, crocodiles have a special transparent third eyelid which allows them to leave their eyes open but prevents damage from the water.\nThey also have external flaps that close off their ears and nostrils, and a special respiratory system that allows them to remain in the water for up to five hours at a time.\nTheir vertically flattened tails are immensely strong and are used to propel them through the water, as although they do have webbed feet, they do not use them to aid them when swimming.\nCrocodiles range in size from the less than 2 meter long dwarf crocodile to the 7 meter long estuarine crocodile (also known as the saltwater crocodile or “saltie”), which is the world’s heaviest reptile weighing up to 1,000kg.\nRead here to learn about crocodile skulls .\nBig aggressive crocodile in the swamp.\n©iStock.com/AppleZoomZoom\nDistribution and Habitat\nCrocodiles are found in a variety of wetland habitats throughout the warmer tropical waters in the southern Hemisphere. Their inability to internally regulate their body temperature means that they rely heavily on the sun to warm their bodies up after it being cooled by spending time in the water.\nAmericas\nThe American Crocodile is the largest crocodilian species in North and South America and is found inhabiting freshwater rivers and lakes, along with brackish coastal waters near estuaries and in lagoons from southern Florida, throughout Central America and into northern parts of South America.\nYoung Nile Crocodile basking on the banks of a river\n©iStock.com/Robby_Holmwood\nAfrica\nOver in Africa, the Nile Crocodile was once widespread in eastern and southern Africa but are now scarcer. They inhabit freshwater marshes, rivers, lakes and mangrove swamps. The world’s largest and most widely dispersed crocodile species is the estuarine crocodile.\nAsia and Australia\nThese formidable reptilian giants are found in river mouths and brackish swamps from the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean, across to and throughout Southeast Asia and down into Australia.\nBehavior and Lifestyle\nCrocodiles have been extensively studies by many researchers and scientists to understand their behavior better. Although many species are mainly reclusive and haven’t been extensively studied, here are some common behavioral patters found in crocodiles.\nCrocodiles bake in the sun during hot daylight hours to prepare for a night of hunting.\n©Khalil Ahmed/Shutterstock.com\nInability to regulate Body Temperature\nIn the same way as other reptiles, crocodiles are not able to regulate their body temperature themselves and instead rely heavily on the heat of the sun to warm their enormous bodies . During the hot daylight hours, they bask in the sun on the riverbanks warming their bodies up from a night of hunting. Smaller species like the dwarf crocodile (which is the least-known of the crocodile species) are also known to climb trees in order to bask on the branches.\nAnother way crocodiles are able to regulate their body temperature is by bobbing up and down in the water, warming in the sun on the surface and cooling themselves down beneath it. Crocodiles are highly sociable animals that remain together in large, mixed groups of adults and juveniles.\nCrocodiles are social animals with a hierarchy led by the largest male.\n©Adam Jones Adam63 / CC BY-SA 3.0 – License\nCrocodiles are Social Animals\nBehavior such as hierarchy, and group feeding have been observed in many of the species. The biggest male is on the top of the hierarchy ladder, and they get to enjoy the best spots for basking. The females always get preference during group feedings when a large animal has been felled by the group. This behavior has especially been observed in the Nile crocodiles and the Mugger crocodiles.\nThis changes when the mating season begins, the males become highly territorial and protect their stretch of river bank from intrusion by competitors by rearing their large heads high up into the air and roaring at intruders. When female Nile crocodiles are attracted by these noises, the males begin to thrash their bodies around and even shoot water into the air from their nostrils.\nHow do Crocodiles Communicate?\nUnlike many other reptiles crocodiles have the ability to communicate with each other. Depending upon the species in question, the size, the sex, and the situation or condition they are in, crocodiles make a variety of sounds to communicate. Here are some common sounds and their meaning:\nChirping – When the eggs are about to hatch, the hatchlings inside the eggs make a ‘squeaky’ noise which prompts the mother to carry the eggs into the water with her mouth. The eggs then hatch in the water and the mother keeps the hatchlings in the water, protecting and feeding them over a period of time.\nDistress – When the young crocodiles are in imminent danger or they feel threatened, they emanate a high-pitched sound that can alert other crocodiles in the area.\nHiss – When they want to threaten others, whether crocodiles or other animals and prey, they make a sound akin to a coughing noise.\nMating call – female crocodiles make a specific noise called the hatching call.\nBellowing – The male crocodiles make a bellowing noise which is a combination of an infrasonic vibration that creates ripples in the water and a vibration in the ground itself. This commonly happens during mating season in spring. Crocodiles also use this noise to scare off other predators and threats in the area.\nCrocodiles are intelligent creatures who study behavior patterns of prey animals before they attack.\n©iStock.com/Maryna Rayimova\nCognitive Intelligence\nCrocodiles are highly observant and they study the behavior of their prey extensively. They study the usual patterns in the behavior of animals that come to drink water near their habitat. Some crocodiles have used nesting materials to lure birds close enough to grab them.\nCrocodiles are cooperative-group-hunters. They swarm larger preys while big crocodile holds it down and others kill it by ripping it apart. They also trap fish by circling them in groups and snatching them one by one.\nCrocodiles are have displayed playful behavior common in social structures, such as locomotive play like repetitive rolling on the slopes, playing with objects, social play like wrestling, swimming and riding ach others backs are common sight in crocodile societies.\nNewly hatched crocodiles often emerge at the start of the rainy season\n©hxdbzxy/Shutterstock.com\nReproduction and Life Cycles\nAfter mating, the female crocodile lays between 17 (dwarf crocodiles) and 100 (Nile crocodiles) eggs in a nest made up of soil and vegetation such as leaves, which prevents the eggs from becoming too cold should the nest become flooded during incubation. In areas prone to flooding, they are also known to build nest mounds to raise the eggs out of the danger from flood waters.\nThe incubation period is usually around 3 months long with hatchlings often emerging to coincide with the beginning of the rainy season to prevent their bodies from drying out. Despite their fearsome reputation, female crocodiles are incredibly caring mothers and guard their nests fiercely to protect them from predators until they are ready to hatch. Once the hatchlings begin to emerge, the female crocodile then helps them down to the water by carrying them in the throat pouch in her mouth.\nInterestingly the thin-shelled, leathery eggs of crocodiles (and indeed other more modern reptile species) was an evolutionary breakthrough for many species as their protective layer and waterproof nature meant that females could lay their eggs on land rather than in water, even in the driest of places, meaning they could be better protected from predators. Typically, crocodiles have a lifespan of 25 to 75 years.\nDiet and Prey\nCrocodiles eat small mammals, birds, fish, bugs, frogs, other species of reptiles, and crustaceans.\n©A-Z-Animals.com\nCrocodiles are carnivorous , formidable predators and at the top of the food chain in their natural habitat. Their inability to chew food has led to the development of ambush hunting techniques, and strong powerful jaws with teeth that are used to tear food apart.\nYoung crocodiles rely heavily on fish, crustaceans, and small mammals, birds and reptiles, but as they grow larger they are able to take much bigger prey species including, deer , zebra and water buffalo.\nCrocodiles are often more active during the night, with some species being known to venture onto land to catch prey, livestock and in some cases, people ( learn more about the most dangerous animals on earth to humans ).\nDue to their highly sociable nature, Nile crocodiles (which predominantly feed on fish), are known to work together in order to cordon fish off in sections of river when they are migrating.\nCrocodiles have a very slow metabolism and can float for a long time without moving.\nIn extreme cases, they seem to be able to go dormant and live off of their own tissues for long periods.\nCrocodiles can live for up to three years without eating.\nCatfish make up a large portion of their natural diets and by keeping their numbers at bay, this allows small fish species to still thrive. These fish (which would ordinarily be quickly eaten by the larger catfish) then provide food for over 40 species of bird, that in return fertilize the waters with their droppings and keep them rich with nutrients so numerous animal species can continue to thrive.\nLearn more about the toughest animals in the world here .\nPredators and Threats\nTigers occasionally prey on crocodiles\n©iStock.com/ANDREYGUDKOV\nDue to the large size and highly aggressive nature of these apex predators, adult crocodiles have very few predators within their natural environments with the exception of occasional takings by big cats such as lions , jaguars, and tigers. The smaller and much more vulnerable juveniles however are preyed upon by a number of animal species around the world from wild pigs, dogs, and large reptiles to birds of prey like eagles .\nAlthough they are common in certain areas, crocodiles are threatened throughout much of their natural ranges from hunting, habitat loss, and ecological changes further down the food chain due to overfishing or water pollution, which then has an impact on them higher up the food chain.\nInteresting Facts and Features\nAlthough most crocodile species inhabit freshwater regions such as swamps, rivers, and lakes, there are a number of species that venture into more salty waters around the coasts. American crocodiles are often found in estuaries and lagoons close to the shores but are able to deal with the higher salinity levels by drinking large amounts of freshwater whenever possible, and by removing salt from the body by secreting crocodile tears through the glands on their face.\nIn periods of drought, they are also known to burrow deep into the mud in order to stop their bodies from drying out and will not eat anything until the water returns. On the other side of the world, estuarine crocodiles have been observed eating pebbles found on the riverbeds. The process of this is thought to help to grind up their food, therefore aiding digestion but also acts as a ballast to help with buoyancy while floating on the surface of the water.\n©A-Z-Animals.com\nCrocodile vs Alligator\nAs noted earlier, the order Crocodilia encompasses crocodiles, alligators, gharial, and caimans. With alligators being common across the Southeastern United States, a common question is what are the key differences between alligators vs. crocodiles ? The two differ most in that:\nCrocodiles have a more pointed (V-shaped) snout while an alligators’ is ‘U-shaped.’\nCrocodile species such as saltwater crocodiles can grow much larger than American alligators.\nAmerican alligators lack a salt gland and primarily live in freshwater while American crocodiles are far more adaptable to saltwater environments.\nRelationship with Humans\nThe relationship between crocodiles and people has been a long-lasting point of contention for thousands of years. Their highly aggressive manner of attacking prey has resulted in numerous human fatalities an on annual basis, with some people actually having been hunted by crocodiles as well as in ambush on the banks of the rivers.\nAlthough death toll numbers are declining due to better education and local knowledge about the formidable nature of these enormous reptiles , around 1,000 deaths are still estimated to occur every year. Crocodiles have also been affected heavily by increasing human activity in many regions around the world, with the expansion of settlements and an increase in river traffic due to hunting, fishing, and tourism.\nCommercial Use of Crocodiles\nCrocodile skin – As formidable as they are crocodiles are farmed in many parts of the world for their hide, which is tanned and turned into apparel, shoes, handbags, belts, etc. Crocodile skin is highly sought after and valuable in the high fashion industry across the globe.\nCrocodile meat – The meat is harvested as it is considered a delicacy and eaten in various countries such as China, Thailand, Cambodia, Korea, Philippines, New Zealand, Bahamas, and even the USA.\nCrocodile oil – Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are extracted from the tissues of the crocodile and sold as crocodile oil. It was extensively used in traditional medicine in many Asian and native cultures. It is used in treating skin conditions, mending wounds and skin tissue, and treating illnesses such as cancer.\nSobek was the revered Crocodile god of ancient Egypt.\n©iStock.com/WHPics\nIn Various Cultures\nThe fierce and formidable nature of crocodiles resulted in their being worshipped in many cultures. In Egypt, Sobek, who represents power and fertility has the head of a crocodile. Also, Taweret, the goddess of fertility, has the tail and back of a crocodile on a human body. In parts of Africa, crocodiles are seen as ancestors and offered food. In Hinduism the god and goddess of water are seen riding crocodiles, and so are a few river deities.\nConservation Status\nToday, although some local populations are thought to be stable, throughout much of their natural ranges the population numbers for all crocodiles species are declining. Out of the 13 different crocodile species, 6 has been listed as Least Concern, 2 have been listed as Vulnerable and 5 have been listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Of all of these species, the Philippine crocodile is by far the most at risk with less than 200 individuals estimated to remain in the wild.\nUp Next:\nCrocodile Death Roll: Everything you Wanted to Know : This nightmarish maneuver is just as bad as it sounds!

Its regal antlers are some of the most notable characteristics in the animal kingdom, used for defense and sexual signaling. When it is disturbed, it can spring into action with its remarkable speed, agility, and finesse. And it has evolved a unique ability to digest all kinds of vegetation. The deer is a kind of evolutionary success story.\n©A-Z-Animals.com\nInteresting Deer Facts\nDeer are animals that have traditionally occupied an integral role in various cultures and mythologies around the world. The famous cave paintings of Lascaux, which date back around 17,000 years, depict a rich, imaginative canvas of horses , deer, and other animals.\nA symbol of strength and nobility, they once adorned many of the flags, banners, and coats-of-arms of medieval Europe.\nMales are known as bucks or stags, while females are called doe. In larger species, the correct terms are bull and cow.\nDeer shed and then grow back their antlers every year after the end of the mating season.\nYou can check out more incredible facts about deer .\nMule deer are named for the shape of their ears and are native to North America.\n©iStock.com/Tiago_Fernandez\nScientific Name\nCervidae is the scientific name for all species of deer. It derives from the Latin word Cervus, which simply means stag or deer. The Cervidae family belongs to the order Artiodactyla, which represents all even-toed ungulates or hoofed animals with a certain kind of foot. The order includes giraffes , bison , hippos , pigs , camels , sheep , and cattle . More recent evidence suggests that cetaceans are also members of the order since they evolved from the even-toed ungulates tens of millions of years ago. Taxonomists generally agree that there are three subfamilies of these animals. Capreolinae, which includes reindeer , white-tailed deer, and moose , is known colloquially as the New World deer. Cervinae, which features the elk, the red deer, the tropical muntjacs, and the tufted deer, are known as the Old World deer. The third subfamily, Hydropotinae, is represented by just the water deer. The terms Old World and New World do not designate the deer’s current range but rather how they evolved. They can be distinguished from each other by key differences in their skeletal morphology. For most people, the Cervidae family is associated with white-tailed deer, red deer, mule deer, elk, caribou , and moose. But the entire family actually contains a massive amount of diversity. Taxonomists seem to disagree on the exact number of species, but by most counts, there are at least 40 still living, each one unique in its own way. Some sources put the number at more than 50 species.\nArticles Mentioning Deer\nKomodo Dragon Population: How Many of These Massive Creatures Still Roam the Earth?\nDiscover the Deepest Lake in Harris County\nThe Tallest Waterfall in Colorado Will Leave Your Utterly Speechless\nBobcats in Arizona: How Many Are There and Where Do They Roam?\nBear Tracks: Identification Guide for Snow, Mud, and More\nDiscover the Longest Bridge in Montana – A 2,437-Foot Behemoth\nBamboo In Alabama\nDiscover the 5 Best Zoos in South Carolina for Animal Encounters\nThe Longest Tunnel in Arizona Feels Like an Endless Underground Adventure\nWatch This Sleeping Dog Miraculously Escape an Attacking Leopard Twice Its Size\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nArticles Mentioning Deer\nThe 10 Largest Lizards in the World\nAlligator vs. Crocodile: 6 Key Differences and Who Wins in a Fight\nThe 10 Absolute Strongest Animals on Earth: Pure Force\nThe 10 Most Alligator Infested Lakes in the United States\nEverything You Want To Know About Muntjac Deer Face Scent Glands\nAre Komodo Dragons Poisonous or Dangerous?\n52 Baby Animal Names: The Big List\nHuge Florida Gator Eats a Smaller Florida Gator in Most Florida Video Ever\nThe Top 10 Cutest Animals in The World\nThe 10 Most Stunning Apex Predators from Around the World\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nThe Irish elk had massive antlers and is believed to have weighed more than 2,000 lbs\n©Daniel Eskridge/Shutterstock.com\nEvolution\nEvidence from the fossil record suggests that these animals likely evolved around 20 million years ago. The earliest species were probably small creatures (much like the present-day mouse deer) with simple, rudimentary antlers and canine tusks. Many species flourished during the recent Pleistocene era, including the truly massive Irish elk, whose antlers may have weighed up to 90 lbs.\nAntlers are the most prominent characteristic of male deer – their size determines hierarchy within the group.\n©WildMedia/Shutterstock.com\nAppearance and Behavior\nMost deer species share in common a basic set of characteristics: two hooves on each foot, a four-chambered stomach, long and spindly legs, short tails, and a coat color that usually varies between brown, red, or gray. They also share a proclivity for the twilight hours. But the most prominent and conspicuous characteristic is the set of antlers on the head. This large ornamentation reveals a clear delineation between the males and the females. All males possess antlers, while females lack them. Only in caribou (or reindeer) do the females grow antlers as well. The water deer is the lone aberration where neither gender grows antlers. Instead, both male and female members grow tusk-like canines instead of the elegant network of antlers. This appears to reflect an earlier pre- antler state of their evolution.\nReindeer are fascinating animals and can easily spot predators thanks to their ability to see ultraviolet light.\n©Pav-Pro Photography Ltd/Shutterstock.com\nThe antlers are composed of simple bone (and thus well-preserved in the fossil record) with a coat of skin and blood vessels called velvet to help them grow. It takes several months for the antlers to reach their full efflorescence, upon which time the deer will slough off the layer of velvet. The antler’s main purpose is to assist the animal in combat and reproduction. As antlers require such a large investment of energy to grow, their size signals to females the reproductive fecundity and overall health of the males. They also help to establish social status and hierarchy in the group. The size, curvature, and structure of the antlers are a source of immense variation between species. Some of them have a large central palmate (like moose antlers), while others have long single beams with varying numbers of branches. Some deer have nothing more than simple spikes for antlers. The reindeer have the largest antlers in relation to body size, but the moose can rival them in absolute terms.\nDeer like to feed during the twilight hours.\n©Volodymyr Burdiak/Shutterstock.com\nDeer are social animals. They usually congregate into small groups for feeding, mating, and protection. In the most densely packed areas, truly massive herds can form, depending on the abundance of food and the makeup of the population. Some species are migratory in nature and will travel hundreds of miles with the herd. To delineate social arrangements, they rely on their acute sense of smell and vocal communication. Many deer have a facial gland near the front of the eyes. The gland can release a strong pheromone for marking its territory when the animal rubs its body against trees or shrubs. Other glands reside on the legs and feet. The smallest species of deer is the humble pudu. It can range anywhere between one and three feet in length. The largest species of Cervidae is the moose. It can reach 10 feet long and weigh up to 1,800 lbs. In between these two extremes lies the common white-tail deer, whose height and weight are about the same as a human. Males tend to be larger than females in almost every species.\nDeer inhabit every continent on earth except Antarctica.\n©Donald Macauley / Creative Commons\nHabitat\nThese animals are present on nearly all continents on earth, including large unbroken expanses of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. It contains only a single species of native deer, the Barbary red deer. Australia has no native species, but several have been introduced into the wild. These animals thrive in deciduous forests, tropical rainforests, wetlands, and grasslands. A few species inhabit the cold tundra of the north, feeding on the sparse vegetation. They are most frequently found in the areas between forests and open plains. They are also capable of adapting to urban and suburban settings, which means that some species can thrive despite human encroachment.\n©A-Z-Animals.com\nDiet\nThese animals’ diet consists almost entirely of leaves, grass, lichen, buds, fruit, and herbs. The deer family is a type of ruminant — a mammal that has the capacity to break down and ferment plants with its four-chamber stomach. Each chamber contains various microbes to assist with this task. After the food is processed by the first stomach, the animal will then regurgitate it as cud and attempt to chew through the tough plant material. The food then proceeds through the remaining chambers of the stomach for digestion. However, unlike many other ruminants such as sheep and cattle, their palate is more selective. They prefer high-quality food that’s easier to digest. This is due to the large amounts of energy and nutrition needed to grow antlers.\nMountain lions, bears, and other large cats prey on deer.\n©Scott E Read/Shutterstock.com\nPredators and Threats\nThese animals are a critical food source for many predators in the wild, including bears , mountain lions , jaguars , tigers , lynxes , coyotes, wolves, and large raptors. Birds and small mammals may feed on the carcass of a deceased deer. Individual animals, especially young fawns, are susceptible to predation. They aren’t completely defenseless against ferocious predators, but when given the choice, they will usually prefer to run. White-tailed deer have the ability to sprint up to 30 MPH. They can also leap immense distances up to 30 feet. If a nearby threat is spotted, deer may attempt to warn nearby members of the herd. The more solitary moose are protected by virtue of their size. Since humans first evolved, deer have been historically an important source of food, clothing, and material to most societies. Modern hunting and habitat loss have threatened some species of deer, particularly in South Asia and the Pacific region, but with responsible stewardship, deer numbers can be maintained at healthy numbers. Climate change presents an acute problem as well. As the deer’s natural habitats change, it will force many of them to venture farther to the north. Other sources of danger include ticks, lice, parasites, and disease. Some of these diseases can be passed on to other types of animals, particularly livestock.\nFawns are often born with white spots to provide camouflage from predators.\n©Steve Byland/Shutterstock.com\nReproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThe deer’s breeding season takes place every year for only a short amount of time. Most species pursue a reproduction strategy known as polygyny in which a single dominant male will have multiple female partners. Only a few species prefer to be monogamous. Because competition can be fierce, males tend to exhibit aggressive tendencies throughout the mating season, as they try to guard their territories and mate against potential rivals. As mentioned previously, antler size is a significant determinant of reproductive success. Once a female deer is impregnated, the gestation period can last anywhere between six to eight months. Mothers will tend to produce one or two offspring at a time. Less commonly, the doe will produce three offspring. The young deer are known as fawns or calves, depending on the size of the species. While out foraging, mothers will hide the fawn in nearby vegetation until the young animal is strong enough to begin walking on its own power. The fawns are often born with white spots to provide camouflage from predators. The offspring are weaned at two to five months, but they may stay with the mother for up to a year. Males often play minimal roles in raising young fawns. After the first year of life, males will begin to grow their antlers on an annual basis. Deer can live around 12 years in the wild, give or take a few years, but hunting, predation, and vehicle collisions can greatly truncate the length of their lives. Many do not live beyond their fifth year of existence.\nSika deer, like the family above, can be found in Japan.\n©Martin Mecnarowski/Shutterstock.com\nPopulation\nDue to commercial exploitation, populations of many deer species fell in the early and mid-20th centuries. But thanks to conservation efforts, populations have rebounded. Some estimates put the population size of the common white-tailed deer at around 30 million. Overpopulation has actually become a significant problem since humans have hunted many of the predators that keep the deer population in check. Therefore, regulated hunting is encouraged in many states as a means of population control. The Americas are rich in several species of deer. The white-tailed deer occupies a large range between the South American coast, Central America, the eastern United States, and parts of Canada. The mule deer tends to occupy the western United States and overlaps with the white-tailed deer in some places. Enormous clusters of deer, including white-tail deer, mule deer, caribou, moose, and elk, congregate in the national parks of western Canada.\nEndangered Species\nDespite their ubiquity, many species and subspecies of deer are under threat. The Persian fallow deer, Chilean huemul, Kashmir stag, Indian hog deer, Bawean deer, and Eld’s deer are either endangered or critically endangered. The reindeer, water deer, barasingha, and others are approaching vulnerable status. Pere David’s deer , which is native to China, was declared extinct in the wild, but attempts have been made to reintroduce them back into their natural habitat.\nAlbino deer are quite rare with a solid white coat with pink eyes, nose, and hooves.\n©iStock.com/giannimarchetti\nTypes of Deer\nThe following list includes the most well-known deer species throughout the world:\nCapreolinnae\nWhite-Tailed Deer – The white-tailed deer is the most common deer species in North America and can be identified by the white underside of its tail. Males tend to be larger than females, weighing up to 400 pounds when fully mature, and regrow their antlers every spring.\nRed Deer – Red deer can be found throughout Europe, parts of Asia, and Northern Africa, and populations have been introduced in New Zealand and Australia. Adult red deer stand about 4 feet high and have a reddish-brown coat.\nMule Deer – Mule deer are indigenous to western North America and are named after their mule-like ears. Some mule deer species have been known to migrate hundreds of miles during winter months.\nElk –\nElk live in North America, Central America, and parts of Asia and can weigh up to 700 pounds. Mature male elk can run at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour.\nCaribou – Also known as reindeer , caribou generally inhabit arctic and subarctic climates. Both male and female caribou grow antlers, and a male’s antlers can reach up to 50 inches long.\nMoose – Moose are the largest member of the deer family and can weigh up to 1,800 pounds. Unlike most other deer species, moose tend to be solitary animals and can become aggressive when threatened.\nBrocket – Brocket deer are small-medium deer found on the Yucatan Penninsula, Central and South America and the island of Trinidad.\nKey – Key deer are a subspecies of white-tailed deer that can only be found in the Florida Keys. They are a little smaller than their white-tailed cousins.\nPadu – At only 13 inches tall, Padu are the world’s smallest deer! The Northern Padu can be found in Venezuela, Columbia, Ecador and Peru. The Southern Padu live in Chile and Argentina.\nBlack-tailed – Black-tailed deer\nCervinae\nBarasingha – Also called the swamp deer, Barasingha deer is a large deer of India with unusual three-tined antlers.

This spotted beauty is native to India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangeladesh.\nFallow Deer – A native species of Europe, the fallow deer is a large animal with pale brown fur with creamy white spots. The fallow’s legs and neck are long and graceful – making it a most beautiful deer!\nMuntjac – There are actually 9 types of Muntjac deer dwelling in southern and southeast Asia. These deer are unique due to their tendency to “bark” when they sense danger – and for their odd “prehistoric-looking” antlers.\nPere David’s Deer – This magnificent deer was nearly hunted to extinction – but has been bred back from captive deer in Eurpean zoos. Pere David’s deer now roam their native China once more!\nPersian Deer – This rare deer ranges in Iran and Israel and is similar to the Fallow deer – with light brown coat with spots.\nRed Deer – One of the largest deer in the world, the red deer has a huge range that includes most of Europe, Caucausas mountain range, Asia, Iran and northwestern Africa – where they are the only deer species.

Frogs are believed to have split from other amphibians approximately 265 years ago – evolving into the modern frogs of today.\nHealth and Entertainment for your Frog\nSee all of our expert product reviews .\nAppearance\nThese animals are characterized by a kind of hunched body, webbed toes, big, bulging eyes, and moist skin. The enormously long legs enable some of them to leap great distances, 20 times or more their body length. Most frogs also have a big visible eardrum on their heads called a tympanum that transmits sound waves to the protected inner ear.\nThe Pickerel frog is the only poisonous frog native to the United States.\n©Matt Jeppson/Shutterstock.com\nThese common traits should not obscure a great deal of diversity in this family. Many unique adaptations help the animal survive in the wild. The glass frog has translucent skin through which you can see its organs to blend in with the environment. The tree frogs have discs on their fingers and toes that enable them to climb up surfaces. The flying frog can glide some 40 to 50 feet from the trees to the ground with the expanded webbing between its toes and fingers. Burrowing frogs often have claws or spade-like structures on their back feet that enable them to dig through the dirt. The leopard frogs have spotted patterns like the big cat for which it’s named.\nThe largest species in the world , the goliath frog , grows up to a foot long and weighs around 7 pounds. The smallest species in the world i s only about 0.3 inches long. But between these two extremes, most of them measure no more than a few inches in size. One type of frog, the Titicaca water frog , is a giant frog endemic to Lake Titicaca.\nThe West African Goliath is the largest frog in the world\n©meunierd/Shutterstock.com\nLike most land animals, an adult has a set of lungs to breathe (the only real exception is species that have no lungs ) and draws oxygen down through its airway passages. But the animal also has porous skin through which it can absorb gasses and water directly. This means it can breathe underwater through its skin . But this also makes the skin very sensitive to dangerous chemicals and pollution that seep into the environment.\nFrog Eyes: What Makes them Unique\nFrogs have unique eyes that have several adaptations that serve them well. For starters, the position of their eyes gives frogs nearly a 360-degree range of sight. Also, frogs have perhaps the best night vision of any animal on the planet! However, frog eyes aren’t perfect. One drawback is they’re generally very far-sighted and can’t see close-up details very well.\nEuropean green tree frog, Hyla Arborea, sitting on a moss-covered branch.\n©Manuel Findeis/Shutterstock.com\nToads vs. Frogs\nFrom a taxonomical perspective, both toads and frogs belong to the same classification, but several anatomical differences distinguish a toad from other frog species. The main differences are that toads have warty skin, shorter legs, and a broader snout. Their skin can tolerate drier conditions, which means they are capable of living father from any source of water.\nBehavior\nThese animals, as a rule, do not have any real social organizations or hierarchies. With few exceptions, these animals mostly hunt and sleep on their own. When they do come together in the breeding season, a group of frogs is called an army. The mating call is the only real means of communication. Each call is loud, conspicuous, and largely unique to the species. Males only make this sound out of necessity, because it has the tendency to attract predators as well.\nAs a cold-blooded amphibian , the animal cannot maintain its internal body temperature. Instead, it needs to constantly change its behavior in response to daily or seasonal fluctuations in temperature, moving into the sun or shade as necessary. In northern climates, most frog species hibernate for the winter by hiding out somewhere and slowing down their metabolisms. The North American wood frog has actually evolved the ability to survive becoming frozen. As its body begins to shut down, the water in the frog’s cells is replaced with glucose and urea to prevent the body tissue from degrading. When the weather warms once again, the metabolism picks up as normal.\nThe wood frog lives farther north than any other North American amphibian. Glucose in the frog’s cells protects its body from damage caused by freezing, although nearly a third of the body fluids can be frozen without killing it.\n©Steve Byland/Shutterstock.com\nBecause they’re so small and vulnerable, these animals have evolved a variety of different defenses to survive. Camouflage is the most common and evolutionary inexpensive defensive mechanism (hence why most species are green or brown in color). A few species like the edible frogs actually have the ability to blend in with the background. The long legs and leaping ability also help many get away from predators. For some species of frogs, poison is its most potent weapon. There are about 170 different species of poison dart frogs , most of which reside in tropical ecosystems. They exhibit bright and garish colors to warn predators that the frog has evolved some of the most potent poisons on the planet. A single gram of toxin from the golden poison dart frog can kill up to 100,000 people. Some species are not toxic but have evolved bright colors to fool predators into believing it’s poisonous.\nAnd as you’ve probably known if you’ve been outside in a less-urban setting at night, frogs are nocturnal .\nMost species of frogs, like this American bullfrog, live on the ground near a source of fresh water.\n©iStock.com/187715314\nHabitat\nThese animals can be found in almost every single continent and region of the planet outside of Antarctica . The greatest diversity of species occurs in the tropics, while many more can be found in temperate regions. Most species tend to live on the ground near the source of freshwater (though a few species can live in brackish/slightly salty water). Some can also burrow underground or inhabit trees.\nRemoving frogs from a habitat\nIf frogs take up residence in a garden or yard there are a number of ways to humanely remove them . Frogs can be relocated, or repellents such as vinegar, lemon juice, coffee grounds, and baking soda are effective at keeping frogs away from gardens. Frogs prefer areas that are warm, moist, and have plant growth. Another way to keep frogs out of yards and in their natural habitats is lawn maintenance, trimming shrubs, and improving drainage.\nHunting skills\nWhen out hunting, an adult usually lies in wait for prey, though some engage in deliberate pursuit. The frog’s long tongue and night vision are its greatest assets. While the teeth on the upper jaw hold the prey temporarily in place, the frog pushes its eyeballs on top of the mouth to force food down the throat.\nFrogs eat crickets, mealworms, caterpillars, and even mice!\n©A-Z-Animals.com\nWhat do frogs eat?\nThe frog’s diet changes drastically between the tadpole phase and the adult phase. After first hatching, most tadpoles tend to eat plankton and other tiny organic matter; though a few species are carnivorous hunters that consume insects , fish , and other tadpoles (even if it means cannibalizing members of their own species). As it undergoes a massive transformation between the tadpole and adult phases, the diet also transitions to an exclusively carnivorous diet consisting of insects, arthropods, or worms. The largest species, such as the African bullfrog , also consume rodents, reptiles , and other frogs.\nPredators and Threats\nFrogs are so common as prey in the wild that many of them never end up surviving beyond the tadpole stage. But they also face many other threats such as habitat loss, pollution, and disease. These problems are all exacerbated by climate change.\nFrogs are prey for almost any carnivorous mammal, bird, or reptile.\n©Tallies/Shutterstock.com\nWhat eats the frog?\nFrogs are preyed upon by almost any kind of carnivorous mammal , bird , or reptile . They are even cannibalized by other frogs.\nReproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nLike all amphibians , frogs have a complex life cycle in which it undergoes a complete transformation between their juvenile and adult stage within the first two months to three years of their life. The juvenile form, also known as a tadpole, is adapted entirely for an aquatic lifestyle. It has an oval body, gills for respiration, a long tail, a cartilage-based skeleton, and no limbs at all.\nAfter undergoing its metamorphosis, the animal’s entire appearance and internal organ structure completely change. As it loses the tail and develops a pair of lungs, the frog is able to leave the water for a completely new life on the land. Only a few tropical species skip the tadpole stage entirely and hatch as young, undeveloped froglets.\nMale glass frogs guard their eggs.\nAt the start of the breeding season, the male makes a loud croaking sound in order to attract a mate. Some species have specialized vocal sacs around the throat or cheeks that amplify the sound and let it carry much further than it normally would. Once he’s attracted a suitable mate, the male grabs the female from behind and fertilizes the eggs right as they’re ejected from her body.\nWhen it comes to reproductive strategy, frogs seem to prefer quantity . Hundreds of thousands of eggs are strung together or float in clusters along freshwater pools or ponds. Most species invest little time or resources into parental care, but there are some exceptions. Among those that do invest time into parental care, one popular strategy is to keep the tadpoles in the mouth or stomach to protect them (the frog temporarily suspends the production of any harmful acids or chemicals that could kill the young). The aptly named marsupial frog has a small pouch with which it protects the young. And the Suriname toad will actually grow a temporary membrane on the back that encases the eggs until they’re fully formed.\nPopulation\nThe total number of frog populations is unknown. They are still abundant around the world, but since the 1950s, many frog populations have been in decline, and around a third of species are now threatened with extinction. According to the US Geological Survey, it’s estimated that the United States is losing approximately 4% of its amphibian population every single year. They are declining even in areas where they’re protected by national law, which suggests a problem with the entire ecosystem.\nThe Australian green tree frog is one species that can be kept as an exotic pet.\n©Kurit afshen/Shutterstock.com\nFrogs as Pets\nFrogs are a popular pet amphibian, but with over 7,000 species there is an incredible variety to choose from. When choosing a pet frog consider the following factors:\nWhile smaller frogs may thrive in a 20-gallon enclosure, larger frogs may require more than 100 gallons, which can become quite large.\nFrogs are ectotherms that rely on their environment to stay warm. That means their enclosures often need heating lamps, under-tank heaters, and other devices to keep pet frogs comfortable.\nMost of these amphibians also require moist conditions to survive. That means you’ll also likely need a water filter and space for frogs to stay moist.\nKeep in mind that frogs can be a commitment. Some species can live up to 20 years when well-cared for in captivity.\nReady to get a pet frog?

Half of my life is spent outdoors, usually with my husband and sweet little fourteen year old dog. We love to take walks by the lake and take photos of the animals we meet including: otters, ospreys, Canadian geese, ducks and nesting bald eagles. I also enjoy reading, discovering books to add to my library, collecting and playing vinyl, and listening to my son's music.\nFrog FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) \nDo frogs give you warts?\nThere’s an old story that touching a frog can give you warts. Is that true? The answer is no, touching a frog cannot give you warts . Warts are instead spread by a virus called HPV.

They are the largest predatory fish species in the world, known to grow to lengths of 8 meters or more and weighing over 2 tons (4,000 pounds). Great white sharks are huge, powerful predators that have developed a fearsome reputation as one of the most prolific “man-eaters” on the planet, with up to half of the annual shark attacks on humans reportedly caused by them. Also known as white sharks and white pointer sharks, great white sharks have been one of the most ruthless ocean predatory fishes for nearly 20 million years. Still, despite their high-profile reputation, they are much less common compared to other widely distributed shark species. Although surprisingly little is still known about their biology and population sizes, it is widely agreed within the scientific community that great white shark population numbers are decreasing worldwide as they are threatened by both hunting and habitat loss throughout much of their natural range.\nEvolution\nSharks have lived on the earth longer than almost any other animal – 450 million years – surviving mass extinctions and every other environmental hazard. 3,000 species have lived over a period of nearly half a billion years – making them an evolutionary success story.\nSilurian Period: 450 Million Years Ago\nSharks began developing as a unique species while the world’s oceans were filled with a variety of fish. The Acanthodian was the very first ancestor of the modern shark. This fish looked like a shark and was the first fish to develop the cartilaginous skeletal structure that sharks have today.\nVery few complete fossils have been found of Xenacanhus and most information about the animal has been found through teeth and spine samples.\n©iStock.com/CoreyFord\nEarly Devonian Era\nThe very first, fully developed shark came on the scene 50 million years after the Silurian era. The Leonodus Shark\nand the Anrarctilamma were two eel-like early sharks in the now-extinct genus Xenacanhus .\nArticles Mentioning Great White Shark\nWatch a Fearless Seal Flip the Script and Stalk a Great White Shark\nWatch 3 Scientists Wrangle a Great White Shark the Size of a Mini Cooper\nSee These Daring Fish Harass a Great White Shark\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off US Waters\nA Shiver of Great White Sharks Spotted Off the Carolina Coast\nThe Largest Bluefin Tuna Ever Caught in Alabama\n1500 LB Great White Just Seen Minutes From North Carolina Beach\nWatch a Famous Diver Calmly Swim With a Great White Shark The Size of a Ford Taurus\nDiscover the Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found off California Waters\nSurprised Fisherman Snags Great White Shark From The Beach\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nArticles Mentioning Great White Shark\nThe 10 Strongest Animal Bite Forces in the World\nThe Top 10 Deadliest Animals in the World\nThe 7 Most Aggressive Sharks in the World\nDiscover How Killer Whales Squeeze Out Great White Livers Like Toothpaste\nThe World’s 10 Favorite & Most Popular Animals\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nWatch This “Colossus” Shark Launch Himself Out of the Ocean\nThe Legendary Black Demon Shark of Mexico\nTop Eight Most Aggressive Animals in the World\nThe 10 Biggest Fish in the World\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nLate Devonian Era\nThe first modern-looking shark, the Cladoselache , broke off from its eel-like cousins. With a six feet long, streamlined body, gill slits, and dorsal fins, this shark lacked the pointed nose and flexible jaw of the modern shark.\nThe Carboniferous Era\nAround 360 million years ago, sharks ruled the oceans and split into many subspecies including rays, skates, and chimaeras. There were 45 different families of sharks during this time, including: Sthacanthus and the unicorn shark, Falcatus.\nJurassic Era\n12 new families of sharks appeared around 200 million years ago during the Jurassic period. Sharks began developing protruding, flexible jaws to enable them to attack larger prey – and tail fins for faster swimming. Their mouths began to form under their snouts and they were able to go deeper to reach more prey. The Hybodus or horned shark lived during this time.\nMegamouth shark, Megachasma pelagios, at Toba Aquarium, Japan\n©Opencage / Creative Commons – License\nCretaceous Period\nDuring this era, 145 – 65 million years ago, sharks evolved that are still in existence today. The Goblin shark, Frilled shark, Whale shark, Basking shark, and Megamouth shark hunted the seas. Lamnidae Sharks or white sharks evolved – the ancestors of great whites, mako, and bull sharks.\nEarly Cenozoic Era\n60 million years ago, during the early Cenozoic period, the Megalodon was the king of sharks. It was the biggest ocean predator ever to exist, 65 feet long and weighing over 30 tons. Megalodon was so fierce and huge with its 7-inch long teeth, that it preyed on whales. Its cousin, the Otodus, at 39 feet, was also a major predator of that era.\nMegaladon weighed as much as 30 large great whites, reached up to 60 feet in length, and ate 2,500 pounds of food each day!\n©Warpaint/Shutterstock.com\nScientists have believed that the great white evolved from Megalodon, Otodus megalodon, one of the largest sharks to have ever lived. Megalodon vanished from the fossil record around 3.6 million years ago. Why? Some scientists have started to theorize, after analyzing numerous fossils, that the great white actually may have helped to drive Megalodon to extinction. Great whites evolved about 4 million years ago, meaning that they lived among Megalodons for approximately 400,000 years. They weren’t as big – but maybe they were better hunters.\nThe Great White Shark is perhaps the deadliest predator in the world.\n©iStock.com/ELizabethHoffmann\nAnatomy and Appearance\nLike almost all shark species, great white sharks have a highly distinctive appearance with large, torpedo-shaped bodies and a pointed snout. They have very tough skin that is covered in tiny teeth called denticles that is slate-grey to black on the top of their bodies which helps them to remain camouflaged on the rocky, coastal sea floors where they are most commonly found. The underside of the great white shark is white and is what has led to its name. Great white sharks have powerful, crescent-shaped tail fins that help to propel them through the water at a tremendous speed and are aided by their pectoral (side) fins that are held out in fixed wings to prevent the great white shark from sinking. The large and highly characteristic dorsal (back) fin of the great white shark is used to help them steer through the water, diving, as well as helping them to balance. One of the most characteristic features of the great white shark is its jaw. Its mouth is filled with up to 300 serrated, triangular teeth arranged in rows and replaced continuously throughout its life. Each tooth can grow to around 6cm in length, giving great white sharks a formidable bite when attacking their prey.\nFace-to-face with a great white shark!\n©Digital Storm/Shutterstock.com\nDistribution and Habitat\nGreat white sharks are widely distributed around the world but are most commonly found in temperate and tropical coastal regions, cooler waters, and the open ocean. Despite this, they are most commonly seen in South Africa (where there are the biggest population numbers), Australia, California, and the northeast of the United States but are also known to range into cooler regions and visit tropical islands, including Hawaii and Seychelles in areas within a greater expanse of open water. Great white sharks swim either below the surface or off the ocean floor, depending on the region and their feeding habits. Their coastal dwelling nature is largely attributed to their prey species. Still, they are also known to travel vast distances through the ocean from South Africa to Australia and from the Californian coast to Hawaii in the deep Pacific.\nGreat white sharks have even been commonly seen leaping out (breaching) of the water, similar to whales when they are attacking their prey from underneath.\n©iStock.com/MR1805\nBehavior and Lifestyle\nGreat White Sharks are largely solitary animals that only tend to come together to mate but have been seen in pairs or small groups around large carcasses. They are highly adaptable and powerful predators that rely less on their eyesight and more on other senses to detect their prey. When in the open oceans, Great White Sharks must swim constantly, or they will drown. Seawater is forced into their mouths and over their gills during swimming, where oxygen is taken in. Great White Sharks swim in an “s” shape to move through the water more efficiently. They can travel vast distances by flexing their body and moving their incredibly strong tail fins from side to side. Powerful and sudden movements of their tail fins enable Great White Sharks to make high-speed dashes when chasing fast-moving prey. They have even been commonly seen leaping out (breaching) of the water, similar to whales when they are attacking their prey from underneath.\nYou can check out some incredible facts about great white sharks .\nReproduction and Life Cycles\nLike many other shark species , female Great White Sharks give birth to live young rather than laying eggs. The female Great White Sharks (bigger than the males) are thought to reach their reproductive stage at around age 17. After an estimated incubation period of between 12 and 18 months, the female gives birth to between 4 and 14 pups, roughly 1.2 meters long (or more). Great White Shark young hatch inside the uterus and are thought to gain nourishment from eating unfertilized eggs and other embryos until they have developed enough to be born. Female Great White Sharks are thought to have a new litter every 2 or 3 years, normally in warm coastal regions where the young have safe nursery grounds to grow. However, habitat degradation and human interference threaten many of these areas to keep Great White Sharks away from regions where people commonly surf and swim .\nA massive great white shark leaping into the air in a grand display.\n©Alexyz3d/Shutterstock.com\nDiet and Prey\nGreat White Sharks are fearsome carnivores that primarily hunt large marine mammals for nutrition. Seals, sea lions, porpoises, dolphins , and smaller whales are among their most commonly hunted prey species worldwide. Great White Sharks have poor eyesight compared to their other senses and use their sense of smell and ability to detect vibrations caused by animals in the water to detect their prey. Once located, Great White Sharks fiercely attack with great speed and force before retreating and leaving their wounded prey to weaken before returning to feed once it is safe to do so. Although largely solitary, Great White Sharks can be seen in pairs or small groups to feed on a large whale carcass. In these circumstances, larger and more dominant individuals feed first with varying swimming display patterns thought to contribute to establishing their dominance hierarchy.\nGreat White Sharks are fearsome carnivores that primarily hunt large marine mammals for nutrition.\n©A-Z-Animals.com\nPredators and Threats\nThe Great White Shark is the largest predatory fish in the ocean and one of the most formidable aquatic hunters in the world, so naturally, very few animals would prey upon fully grown Great White Sharks. However, the smaller and more vulnerable juveniles are threatened by large ocean predators, including Killer Whales and other shark species. The biggest threats to the global population of Great White Sharks are those caused by people. Great Whites are hunted for their jaws, teeth, and fins by fishermen and trophy hunters and are also sometimes accidentally caught in nets fishing for other species such as Tuna. Beaches meshed to protect swimmers from shark attacks and habitat degradation throughout their natural range have also contributed to the global decline in population numbers.\nAfter a particularly big feast, a Great White Shark may not feed properly again for up to 3 months.\n©Alessandro De Maddalena/Shutterstock.com\nInteresting Facts and Features\nGreat White Sharks have an exceptional sense of smell which they use to detect prey. Amazingly they are known to be able to sniff out blood in the water from one-third of a mile. Along with other shark species, Great White Sharks have special organs known as lateral lines (rib-like lines on the sides of their body), which can detect the tiny electromagnetic field generated by other animals in the water, which they use to find prey. Hunting larger prey species means that feeding for Great White Sharks can be done more efficiently than if they fed on smaller fish and birds. Great White Sharks are thought to consume an average of 11 tonnes of food every year and, after a particularly big feast, may not feed properly again for up to 3 months. In some situations, Great White Sharks have been known to swim along baring their teeth, which is thought to both serve to warn off competitors for food and rival sharks that may be intruding on their personal space. The Great White Shark is also one of the biggest fish in the world .\nGreat white sharks have developed a bad reputation among predatory fish.\n©J nel/Shutterstock.com\nRelationship with Humans\nHumans have a long-established negative relationship with Great White Sharks all around the world, as they are responsible for the majority of all shark attacks on people. Although such attacks are widely documented in the news, fatalities from Great White Shark attacks are thought to be less common than those caused by lightning strikes or bee stings. Due to how Great White Sharks hunt (known as sample biting, where they first attack their prey to wound it before returning to eat), it is widely believed that people are not considered a desirable meal for them. In such instances, returns are incredibly rare. The high-profile nature of these attacks, though, has led to Great White Sharks developing a reputation of being fierce man-hunters when they have mistaken a person swimming or surfing for a seal on the surface of the water. Great White Sharks have also been known to bite or repeatedly bash small boats with their snouts and can cause enough damage to make them sink.\nGreat White Sharks are the most aggressive sharks worldwide.\n©Willyam Bradberry/Shutterstock.com\nWhile attack levels are below many other animals worldwide, Great White Sharks are the most aggressive sharks worldwide , having recorded 333 attacks on humans and 52 fatalities since 1958.\nConservation Status and Life Today\nAlthough little is known about the exact global population numbers of Great White Sharks , particularly in regions where they are less common, their numbers are thought to have declined rapidly over recent years. The IUCN now lists great White Sharks as an animal that is Vulnerable in their native environments, and they are also more heavily protected in certain areas. Hunting, habitat degradation, and campaigns to kill Great White Sharks after a high-profile attack documented in the media have led to their population declines, along with the capture of them to be exhibited in aquariums worldwide.\nMore on Great White Sharks\nHow Deep Can Great White Sharks Dive and What’s Their Deep Sea Prey?\nDiscover Why No One Has Ever Seen a Great White Shark Give Birth\nView all 168 animals that start with G\nAbout the Author\nLisha Pace\nAfter a career of working to provide opportunities for local communities to experience and create art, I am enjoying having time to write about two of my favorite things - nature and animals.

The entire population of Syrian hamsters is believed to be descendants of a single brother-sister pair captured from Aleppo, Syria, in 1930.\nAfter being imported to Jerusalem, they bred very successfully. Later, some animals from this original breeding colony were exported to the United States, where they quickly became popular as pets and laboratory animals. Comparative studies between wild and domesticated Syrian hamsters have revealed reduced genetic variability within the domestic strain. However, any differences found remain relatively small when compared with other variations seen in other lab animals.\nThe entire population of Syrian hamsters is believed to be descendants of a single brother-sister pair captured from Aleppo, Syria, in 1930.\n©Mary Swift/Shutterstock.com\nAppearance\nHamsters are small rodents that have stout bodies. Their legs are stubby and stocky legs, and their ears are small. Hamsters have short tails that are even shorter than the length of their bodies. Their ears are furry, and their feet are wide.\nThough most species have fairly similar bodies, each one has identifying markings and sizes that determine which species they are. The dwarf hamster, much like their name, is a very tiny rodent. They are about 2 to 4 inches long.\nOn the other hand, the Syrian hamster is quite different. It is also referred to as a teddy bear hamster or golden hamster, growing to approximately 6 inches long as an adult. On average, a hamster weighs about 6.2 ounces, making it rather small with very little muscle.\nIn general, hamsters have thick and silky fur, and it could be long or short, depending on the hamster. This fur comes in a variety of colors, including black, grey, yellow, red, brown, and white. Some hamsters also have fur that is a blend of several different colors, but the combination will be determined by the breed.\nThese rodents have a scent gland that is located in the middle of their bodies. In the case of a dwarf hamster, the scent gland is located in the hamster’s stomach, allowing them to mark their territory. However, the Syrian hamster (aka the teddy bear hamster) has scent glands on their hips instead.\nInterestingly, hamsters have a natural way to get out of trouble when they need to escape – their skeletons. The flexibility of their rib cage allows them to flatten their body under small crevices. Anyone that owns such a pet will need to have a secure cage to keep them from escaping.\nHamsters are small rodents that have stout bodies. Their legs are stubby and stocky legs, and their ears are small.\n©An13nA/Shutterstock.com\nBehavior\nMost wild hamsters are active during dusk time and night and need plenty of space to play at night time. Some of them can easily run up to 5 miles during this time. When hamsters are kept as pets, they maintain this natural routine.\nTheir waking hours take up the nighttime, whether in the wild or in captivity, which means that they are awake during the night. They prefer to be undisturbed, so wild hamsters will avoid other wildlife and people during this time. Any unwarranted disturbance in their sleep could very well lead to a bite from these tiny rodents.\nThey survive best in rooms where the lights are not kept on till very late. In the wild, many hamsters dig burrows, and several others are solitary creatures, which is why they need plenty of areas to conceal themselves. Wild hamsters hibernate during the cold weather months. These rodents get up during their hibernation periods only to eat occasionally.\nA loner hamster, it is said, should never be put in a cage with other hamsters as it can bite and harm it and, in some cases, even kill it. The only time that these animals are especially friendly towards other hamsters is when they are young (i.e., under three months old). They will even eat their young if they so desire.\nThe dwarf hamster is an exception. They are surprisingly social, and they enjoy having multiple friends around in their family.\nIn captivity, hamsters can sometimes flinch, grimace, and raises its hand toward their owners. This simple motion is an indication that the hamster may be ready to attack, showing exactly how they feel about the person infiltrating their safe space.\nIf a human earns the trust of a hamster as a pet, the animal will gently move towards their hand and even crawl into it. They are fairly expressive animals, and there is no doubt about how they feel about their owner or surrounding animals.\nIn the wild, hamsters can run 5 miles per night. An exercise wheel is essential, whether your hamster gets time out of its cage or not.\n©Katinka Bakos/Shutterstock.com\nHabitat\nThe first of these small rodents was found in Syria . However, they are also found in Belgium , northern China , Romania , and Greece . In the wild, hamsters prefer living in warm and dry areas. They like living in steppes, edges of deserts , and sand dunes.\nHamsters have also become an incredibly popular pet, and there are many toys and hideaways that can be added to their home to recreate their natural surroundings.\nIn the wild, hamsters live in steppes, edges of deserts, and sand dunes\n©Lubomir Novak/Shutterstock.com\nDiet\nThe primary diet of Hamsters includes seeds, nuts, grains, fruits, vegetables, and cracked corn. Apart from that, hamsters also eat small insects, lizards , as well as other small animals.\nInterestingly, hamsters have pouches on the inside of their cheeks, and they carry food in these pouches to store and eat later.\nThe primary diet of Hamsters includes seeds, nuts, grains, fruits, vegetables, and cracked corn.\n©A-Z-Animals.com\nPredators and Threats\nHamsters are known to defend themselves against these predators by using their incisors which are large in size. The mother hamsters also carry their children to safety by putting them in the pouches in their mouths.\nThe predators of this small animal are numerous since they are small and easy to pick up. However, they are quite fast and spritely.\nWhat Eats Hamsters?\nThe common predators of hamsters include snakes , birds, and other predatory mammals. That doesn’t mean that a hamster won’t put up a good fight. Instead, they use their naturally long incisors to bite. If the hamster is a new mother, she will keep her young safe within her mouth’s pouches.\nInterestingly, the most likely cause of death in hamsters isn’t being hunted – it is heart disease.\nWhat Do Hamsters Eat?\nHamsters, in turn, feed on seeds, grains, fruits, nuts, cracked corn, small insects, lizards , and other animals. They are herbivores, so they do not seek out any other animal as prey.\nThese animals should never eat kidney beans, tomato leaves, or unwashed produce. All of these sources of nutrients are incredibly toxic.\nThe most common predators of hamsters are snakes and birds.\n©iStock.com/hikaru1222\nReproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nBoth male and female hamsters are known to be fast maters. They are known to waste no time in the process of reproduction, and it is often said that if hamsters from two separate genders are locked in a cage, the female can very quickly conceive.\nThe gestation period in hamsters is about 15 to 20 days. A group of hamster babies, known as a litter, is born shortly after. The average litter size is six to eight pups. The hamster babies are blind till about two weeks after their birth. They have to be weaned when they are about three to four weeks old. However, these animals should be watched carefully, as they are one of many animals that may eat their young.\nIt is said that female hamsters give birth to two to three litters of hamster babies annually. The lifespan of these small rodents is about one to two years. In captivity, they can survive up to three years.\nHamsters have an average of six to eight pups per litter and can mate two or three times per year.\n©iStock.com/Mikhail Davidovich\nHamsters vs. Mice\nWhen comparing a hamster vs. a mouse , hamsters are generally larger than mice. In addition, hamsters generally are found in a wider variety of colors than mice. Mice are also more opportunistic eaters, while hamsters are known to hoard food and even store it in their mouths.\nHamsters vs. Guinea Pigs\nAnother popular pet rodent that hamsters are often compared with is guinea pigs . Guinea pigs are generally larger than hamsters and weigh several pounds, whereas hamsters weigh less than a pound. In addition, hamsters are omnivores, while guinea pigs are strict herbivores.\nPopulation\nWhile it is not known how many hamsters live in the wild all over the world, it has been said that the pet population of hamsters is around 57 million. About 11 million households have hamsters as pets .\nHamsters in the Zoo\nLittle is known about hamsters living in zoos. However, it is said that they multiply quickly and find their way into parks, universities, and zoos. For anyone that wants to learn more about hamsters in an up-close way, most pet stores will carry at least a few different species.\nThe population of pet hamsters is approximately 57 million. The wild population is unknown.\n©iStock.com/Conny V\nThe 19 Types of Hamsters\nThe subfamily Cricetinae contains 19 different species of hamsters from different geographical regions. Of these hamsters, many are never kept as pets. The five most commonly-kept types of hamsters for pet owners are Syrian hamsters, Campell’s dwarf hamsters, Roborovski dwarf hamsters, winter white dwarf hamsters, and Chinese hamsters.\nSyrian Hamster – Syrian hamsters are a common type of hamster kept as a pet. They can grow up to 6 inches long and are usually golden brown with darker markings around their cheeks. Syrian hamsters tend to be more solitary, so they should be kept to one in a cage. They can get along well with pet owners if proper interaction and entertainment are provided.\nCampbell’s Dwarf Hamster – One of only two species of Russian dwarf hamsters, the Campbell’s Dwarf hamster is a very common pet store find. They were named after Charles William Campbell, who first caught one in Mongolia in 1904. They come in many colors and are friendly, boisterous, and active. Campbell’s Dwarf hamsters can become territorial if kept in groups. This means they should be kept in very large enclosures. Additionally, this species is genetically predisposed to developing diabetes.\nRoborovski Dwarf Hamster – The Roborovski hamster is a small, energetic, and wild hamster species that originates from central Asia’s deserts. They have become popular pets recently due to their fun temperament and tiny size. These hamsters only reach an average length of 2 inches. Still, their fluffy fur comes in various colors, making them look extremely cute. Although they make great pets to observe, they require a large cage and many different toys.\nWinter White Dwarf Hamster – The Winter White Dwarf hamster is similar to the Campbell’s Dwarf hamster but has a different body shape and comes in different colors. They also are more mild-mannered and reserved than Campbell’s hamsters. The name “Winter White Dwarf hamster” comes from the fact that these hamsters’ fur usually turns white in the winter to camouflage themselves from predators. Winter white dwarf hamsters can cross-breed with Campbell’s hamsters, so it can be difficult to find a purebred Winter white dwarf hamster.\nChinese Hamster – The Chinese hamster is a small, energetic hamster that can be difficult to handle. These hamsters require large enclosures with plenty of space to run around. Several states have labeled them pests, so special permits are required.\nChinese Striped Hamster – The Chinese Striped hamster is a species of hamster that is native to central and eastern Asia.

It is considered an agricultural pest and is often hunted for its fur. While it is not considered endangered globally, it is critically endangered in many countries. European hamsters are crepuscular and eat mostly plant matter, like seeds, legumes, grasses, vegetables, and insects. They are often solitary.\nEversmann’s Hamster – Eversmann’s hamster is a species of hamster that is native to Kazakhstan. It is named after the Russian naturalist, zoologist, and explorer Eduard Friedrich Eversmann. Eversmann’s hamster is part of the family Cricetidae, which is the second-largest family of mammals.\nGansu Hamster – The Gansu hamster is an endangered species of rodent native to China, easily identified by its small size, round head, short legs, large ears, and long tail. It inhabits grasslands up to two miles above sea level and feeds on seeds and roots. As the only member of its genus (Cansumys), it is often referred to as “the lone hamster.”\nGreater Long-Tailed Hamster – The Greater Long-Tailed hamster is a hamster species in Northern China. It has been considered a major pest in China since ancient times because it eats crops all year round. The hamster also often stands up on its hind legs and screams loudly as a way of communicating with others.\nGrey Dwarf Hamster – The Grey Dwarf hamster is a common hamster species found in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Russia, Central Asia, Mongolia, and western China. These hamsters have an average body length of 4 inches, with a furry tail about 1/3 of that length. Their fur is brownish-grey with white underparts, and they have large ears and a flattened skull. Grey Dwarf hamsters are known for their burrows, which can be as deep as 5 feet beneath the ground. These hamsters do not hibernate, so they are active year-round as they forage for roots, plants, seeds, and insects.\nKam Dwarf Hamster – The Kam Dwarf hamster is a hamster species found only in the mountains of western China. These hamsters have an average body length of 4 inches and a tail length of 2 inches. Their fur is greyish-brown in color, and their underside is greyish-white. These hamsters are active day and night and dig burrows to an average depth. They forage for grain and seeds, and they also hunt insects.\nLong-Tailed Dwarf Hamster – The Long-Tailed Dwarf Hamster is a hamster species found in Mongolia, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia. It has an average body length of about 4 inches, with a tail at least 1/3 of that length. It is sandy brown in color on its back, with a greyish-white belly.

It is nocturnal and feeds on seeds and insects.\nMongolian Hamster – The Mongolian hamster is a type of hamster that is found in China and Mongolia. It is relatively muted, with a sandy brownish-grey top coloring and light grey underside coloring.\nRomanian Hamster – The Romanian hamster is a species of hamster found in both Bulgaria and Romania. It is brown with a white underside and a black stripe that runs from its head to its neck. It is around 7 inches long and is nocturnal. It lives solitarily in burrows, where it stores and eats seeds, vegetables, grasses, legumes, and insects.\nSokolov’s Dwarf Hamster – This type of hamster is usually grey, with a light brown or yellow hue and a dark stripe running down its body. It has a body length of about 3.7 inches and a 1-inch tail. It is found in China and Mongolia, where it lives in underground burrows beneath desert shrubs.\nTibetan Dwarf Hamster – The Tibetan Dwarf hamster is a species of hamster that is found in Tibet, as well as India, Nepal, and China. It prefers to live in mountainous regions and can be found in altitudes of up to 17,100 feet. This hamster lives in desert steppes, scrublands, swampy grasslands, and Alpine meadows. It has a body about 4 inches long, with a tail of 1.5 inches.\nTurkish Hamster – The Turkish hamster originates in Turkey, Armenia, and several other surrounding nations. It is closely related to the Syrian hamster but is not as well known and rarely kept as a pet. The Turkish hamster population is decreasing in the wild. However, they are often still used as lab test species. These extremely adaptable hamsters live in sand dunes, scrublands, and desert steppes. These areas are very dry with little plant matter, so the hamsters burrow 6 feet under the ground for shelter.\nView all 104 animals that start with H\nAbout the Author\nHeather Hall\nI am a freelance writer with 22 years of experience.

Not known to the world until the First World War, the Komodo Dragon is actually a species of Monitor Lizard that evolved in isolation for millions of years. These lizards are not only the largest in the world but are also one of the most aggressive and dangerous . They are so powerful that they are able to take down prey many times their own size. Komodo Dragons are in severe danger of extinction in their natural environments due to climate change, habitat loss, and a shortage of prey. Population decline has led to these lizards being listed on the IUCN’s Red List, providing this species with legal protection.\nEvolution\nThe komodo’s very own evolutionary branch made the move to Asia from Australia as a result of the collision of the two continents 15 million years ago. \nThe presence of the komodo dragon on the southernmost continent is further supported by evidence that it also mated with the sand monitor’s forbears. \nHowever, its true origins began 40 million years ago when its ancestors made their way from Asia to Australia, where its ancestors grew to immense sizes, with the Varanus priscus being the largest of all at 23 feet long.\nAnatomy and Appearance\nKomodo Dragons have excellent eyesight and powerful jaws\n©iStock.com/desertsolitaire\nArticles Mentioning Komodo Dragon\nKomodo Dragon Population: How Many of These Massive Creatures Still Roam the Earth?\nThe Largest Komodo Dragon Ever Was the Length of a U-Haul Truck: 3 Reasons It Grew Into Such a Monster!\nWatch This Powerful Komodo Dragon Charge Into the Sea and Ambush a Swimming Deer\nWatch These Two Muscular Komodo Dragons Trade Intense Blows\nHow Do Lizards Mate?\nDiscover the 3 Best Zoos in North Carolina (And the Ideal Time to Visit Each)\nWatch a Mighty Komodo Dragon Snag a Seagull and Down It in One Bite\nWatch an Unfazed Komodo Dragon Calmly Devour an Entire Monkey in One Bite\nWatch a Tenacious Komodo Dragon Causally Swallow an Entire Stingray Whole\nWatch This Gigantic Komodo Dragon Dominate a Turtle and Wear Its Shell as a Hat\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nArticles Mentioning Komodo Dragon\nThe 10 Largest Lizards in the World\nAre Komodo Dragons Poisonous or Dangerous?\nThe 10 Most Stunning Apex Predators from Around the World\nTypes of Lizards: The 15 Lizard Species You Should Know!\nThe 19 Dumbest Animals in the World\nDiscover the Largest Komodo Dragon Ever!\nThe 10 Largest Animals In The World\nThe 9 Most Interesting Animals in the World\n9 Incredible Lizards That Look Like Dragons\nWhat Do Komodo Dragons Eat?\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nKomodo Dragons are enormous reptiles that can grow up to three meters long and weigh 150kg. They are incredibly aggressive with long, thick bodies, short, muscular legs, and a powerful tails. Their tail is used for both fightings and for propping the animal up when it is standing on its hind legs. The Komodo Dragon is an animal with long, sharp, curved claws that are often used for digging. Greyish brown skin is covered in small scales and folds around the neck. Komodo Dragons have relatively small heads compared to their large body size and wide, powerful jaws concealing a mouth filled with deadly bacteria and sharp teeth. Although Komodo dragons have good eyesight, they mainly rely on their forked tongue to smell their environments. By flicking its tongue out of its mouth, the lizard is able to “taste” scent particles in the air and locate live or dead prey up to 8km away.\nThe largest Komodo Dragon ever recorded weighed 365 pounds!\nDistribution and Habitat\nKomodo dragons can only be found on five Indonesian islands\n©GUDKOV ANDREY/Shutterstock.com\nAlthough the Komodo Dragon was once been widespread across many Indonesian islands, they are confined to just five today, all within Komodo National Park. The islands of Komodo, Rintja, Gillimontang, Padar and the western tip of Flores are the last remaining homes for these enormous animals. Habitats include open woodlands along with dry savannah and scrubby hillsides, occasionally dried-up river beds. Komodo Dragons are thought to have evolved to be so big due to the presence of a number of large mammalian species that are now extinct and the lack of other large predators.\nBehavior and Lifestyle\nKomodo Dragons are ambush predators and prefer to lie in wait for their prey\n©Raul / Creative Commons\nKomodo dragons are solitary and powerful predators, roaming territories dependent on the individual’s size, covering a distance of around 2km every day. They are also known to be excellent swimmers, traveling from one island to another over a relatively long distance. Although they are solitary animals, a number of Komodo Dragons will often gather around a single kill. In order to catch large animals, these lizards sit for hours, hidden in the vegetation, camouflaged by grey-brown skin. They then ambush the victim with incredible speed and force.\nReproduction and Life Cycles\nBesides feeding on a large carcass, Komodo Dragons reside in groups during the breeding season, around September, when nearby males fight standing on their hind legs, propped up by their tails, vying for breeding rights. After mating, females lay up to 25 leathery eggs in a hole made of soft sand. The young hatch after an incubation period between 8 and 9 months and have distinguishing cream bands (which they lose as they get older). Young Komodo dragons are completely independent of the time they leave their shell. However, until they grow to a larger size, this young venture up into the trees, spending most of their time there until they are large enough to fend for themselves on the ground. These reptiles live for an average of 30 years in the wild.\nDiet and Prey\nKomodo dragons hunt large herbivores and swallow chunks of their food rather than chew it\n©Sergey Uryadnikov/Shutterstock.com\nThe Komodo Dragon is a carnivorous predator that relies on large animals, such as pigs, goats, deer, and even horses and water buffalo , as prey. Komodo dragons have the ability to attack prey much larger than them. Even if unsuccessful upon ambush, they will follow the injured prey for miles, waiting until it dies from sepsis caused by deadly bacteria in the reptile’s mouth. Young will prey on smaller animals mainly in the trees such as snakes, lizards, or birds. The teeth of this animal are sharp and serrated, good for the kill and tearing meat, but useless for chewing. Instead, Komodo dragons tear bits off the carcass, and throw it back into their mouths, swallowing it whole aided by their flexible neck muscles.\nPredators and Threats\nKomodo dragons are apex predators\n©Sergey Uryadnikov/Shutterstock.com\nDue to the fact that the Komodo Dragon is the most dominant predator in its environment, mature adults have no natural predators in their native habitats. Upon the first arrival of people on the islands, the Komodo dragon’s lifestyle changed dramatically. Humans hunt these lizards and encroach into their native habitats to establish settlements and clear forests for timber and agriculture. Volcanic activity also threatens these animals, as the islands are geologically active. Events such as this lead to declines in prey species, in turn affecting the local Komodo Dragon populations.\nKomodo Dragons were Unknown Until Recently\nAlthough Komodo Dragons have thrived in this part of the Indonesian archipelago for millions of years, they were unknown to the world until around a century ago. Initial reports came from a pilot stranded on Komodo Island after his plane crashed into the ocean. A species of Pygmy Elephant , thought to have now been extinct for thousands of years now, may have been a main source of food for Komodo dragons at one point. The main prey sources of Komodo dragons today were introduced by human settlers.\nKomodo Dragons are Venomous\nThe Komodo Dragon has fifty different types of toxic bacteria in their saliva that thrive on traces of flesh, causing bite wounds to quickly become infected. However, recent studies indicate that the real reason for such a high success rate in killing prey could be down to the fact that a venom gland exists in this reptile’s mouth.\nResearchers in Australia had the rare opportunity to examine two Komodo dragons that were put down in zoos due to terminal illnesses. The team found that the animal does possess a venom gland with venom capable of rapidly decreasing blood pressure and blood loss – sending the victim into shock and making it too weak to fight. Some compounds in the venom that reduce blood pressure were as potent as the world’s most venomous snake, the inland Taipan of Western Australia.\nKomodo dragons also possess a venom delivery duct system that is more complex than the ones employed by snakes. While snakes have a single venom duct behind their fangs – Komodos have multiple ducts between their teeth. This means that instead of simply injecting venom with a bite – Komodo dragons bite and pull their victims to ooze the venom into wounds during a long, frenzied attack. This finding makes the whole bacteria theory almost laughable compared to this nightmarish means of killing. Read Are Komodo Dragons Poisonous or Dangerous? for more information.\nRelationship with Humans\nSince their discovery on the islands around 100 years ago, Komodo Dragons fascinate and honestly terrify people as we deduce more about them. Habitat loss on the islands not only means that Komodo Dragons face being pushed into isolated regions, but they are also coming into closer contact with human activity, leading to negative wildlife-livestock interactions. Despite their seemingly slow and docile nature, Komodo Dragons run at speeds of up to 11mph in short bursts and are actually one of the world’s known “man-eaters.” People have not only been ambushed but also bitten and then tracked by Komodo Dragons.\nConservation Status and Life Today\nToday, the Komodo Dragon is listed by the IUCN as a species that is “vulnerable in its natural environment” and potentially faces extinction in the near future due to loss of habitat mainly from human activity, such as agricultural expansion. Although once widespread on numerous Indonesian islands, they are now confined to just a few with between 3,000 and 5,000 individuals thought to be left roaming the rich, volcanic forests. However, increasing interest in these creatures from tourists gives locals more reason to protect them and their critical habitats.\nSimilar Animals\nIguana:\nLarge and colorful, they’re considered an invasive species in some regions and a favorite among pet enthusiasts in others.

While both are extremely effective predators, the size of a Komodo dragon would be too much for the honey badger to overcome. The two live in very different geographies, so this battle has never happened in nature.\nWhat's the difference between Komodo dragons and monitor lizards?\nKomodo dragons are the largest species of monitor lizard .

Lizards are paraphyletic, which means that a small number of species share more in common with their sister suborders than they do with their own order of Lacertilia.\nThere are more than 7,000 distinct lizard species in the world and the number is being revised upwards on a constant basis. While it might be assumed that limbed lizards descended from limbless snakes, the opposite is true, and it is lizards that are the forebears of the snake family, not the other way around. Some form of this reptile is found on every continent of the world except for Antarctica .\n6 Incredible Lizard Facts!\nThese reptiles are ectothermic, which means that their body temperature is not fixed as in mammals but is dependent on environmental conditions.\n©Ruben PH/Shutterstock.com\nArticles Mentioning Lizard\nDiscover the Largest Solar Farm in Utah (And What Lives Around It)\nKomodo Dragon Population: How Many of These Massive Creatures Still Roam the Earth?\nDiscover the 7 Most Dangerous Animals Lurking in Texas’s Lakes and Rivers\nBobcats in Arizona: How Many Are There and Where Do They Roam?\nDiscover the Largest Forest in Kansas (And the Creatures Lurking Within It)\nDo Ocelots Make Good Pets?\nHow Do Lizards Mate?\nUnwelcome Visitor: Watch This Huge Lizard Waltz Into a Woman’s Tent and Scare Her Stiff\nWatch This Fearless Heron Eat an Alligator in One Bite… Yes, an Alligator!\nWatch This Covert Crocodile Breach the Water and Attack Swooping Bats\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nArticles Mentioning Lizard\nThe 10 Largest Lizards in the World\nThe 10 Most Alligator Infested Lakes in the United States\nAre Komodo Dragons Poisonous or Dangerous?\nThe 10 Best Animals to Keep as Pets\nTop 9 Largest Eagles in the World\nThe 10 Most Stunning Apex Predators from Around the World\nThe Top 10 Biggest Spiders in the World\nTypes of Lizards: The 15 Lizard Species You Should Know!\nThe 19 Dumbest Animals in the World\nMeet Every Dinosaur Featured in Jurassic World Dominion (30 Total)\nSee all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .\nAdult lizards range in length from the 2 cm (0.8 inches) of the smaller geckos to the 3 meters (10 feet) of the monitor lizards and weigh anywhere from less than ½ gram (.02 ounce) to 150 kg (330 pounds).\nWith the sole exception of the Marine Iguana of the Galapagos Islands, all species bear the classification of land-based animals. Even the Marine Iguana spends much of its time sunning itself on rocks.\nAmong those of the venomous lizard classification, the Gila Monster and the Beaded Lizard of the Southwestern United States and the Sonoran desert of Mexico are the most widely known. Some species of monitor lizards also possess various degrees of toxic venom.\nSeveral species possess the ability to voluntarily detach their tails, used primarily as a way of distracting predators, and then regenerate them at a later date.\nA number of species possess the ability to change color in order to camouflage themselves from predators or blend in with their surroundings in order to trap their own prey.\nAs a general classification, these reptiles are ectothermic, which means that their body temperature is not fixed as in mammals but is dependent on the environmental conditions around them. Lizards all have ranges of ideal body temperatures where they function with maximum efficiency and are much less active when they cannot attain the proper degree of internal body heat.\nScientific Name\nLizards are reptiles of the order Squamata, which comes from the Latin “squamates”, scaly or having scales.\n©reptiles4all/Shutterstock.com\nLizards are reptiles of the order Squamata , which comes from the Latin “squamates”, scaly or having scales. There are three suborders of Squamata: snakes , amphisbaenians (worm lizards), and lizards. Together, the three suborders comprise nearly 11,000 species and are the second-largest group of vertebrates on the planet today.\nHealth and Entertainment for your Lizard\nSee all of our expert product reviews .\nCharacteristics of Lizards\nLizards can range in size from less than an inch to 10 feet in length and have incredibly varied appearances.\n©reptiles4all/Shutterstock.com\nScales and Appearance\nAs their presence in order Squamata makes clear, the primary characteristic of these reptiles is their scaly skin. The scales themselves, made of keratin, act as an armor to seal in water that would otherwise evaporate, and protect it from varied environments, like dry deserts, for example.\nThe scales can come in a variety of structures, such as plate-like, smooth and overlapping, and ossified. As a lizard grows, it will shed its tough skin in pieces. Some lizards have spiny scales that protect them from predators.\nWith some exceptions, lizards have four legs, long tails, external ear openings, and movable eyelids. Their bodies are rounded, their necks short, and their heads are elevated. A notable feature of this reptile as well as all the other members of the order Squamata is the ability to open both its upper and lower jaws. This allows them to swallow much larger prey than is possible among those animals with just a movable lower jaw.\nThe popular image of a lizard as a low-slung creature that either writhes slowly or scampers quickly along close to the ground only applies to a limited number of lizard species. Among the thousands of variants, there are also lizards with long hind legs that run as bipeds, others that glide with skin flaps extended as rudimentary wings, and even other species which have no limbs and move in the same manner as a snake.\nMales often display various types of ornamentation such as permanent horns and crests as well as features of a temporarily deployable nature such as large mane-like frills and crests that are designed to attract females or to frighten away predators by making the animal appear much larger and more threatening than it truly is.\nLong tongues are seen in many species. Some of these are intended for use as sensory probes employed in hunting while other limited numbers of species that do not have eyelids use their lengthy tongues as something similar to a windshield wiper for their eyes.\nIn general, lizards have very good eyesight . Of all lizard species, chameleons have some of the most developed eyesight. They can see in a 360-degree field of vision and also in a wide range of colors and into the UV spectrum.\nThese reptiles come in many different colors, including species with bands of color, species with a tail of a different color when they are young, and several species that are capable of changing their color to better blend in with their surroundings.\nThis last attribute, best known in the chameleon , is both an offensive and defensive attribute. It allows the individual lizard to foil predators looking for it and also disguises itself so that its own prey can be lured close enough for capture.\nVenom\nThe Mexican beaded lizard, one of the two species of venomous beaded lizards found principally in Mexico and southern Guatemala\n©Danny Ye/Shutterstock.com\nSome lizards produce venom in their oral glands. Nine different toxins that are produced by snakes can also be found in lizards. One example is the toxins found in rattlesnake venom–the same toxins are present in the venom of a bearded dragon, which is a popular pet among lizard enthusiasts. Other venomous lizards include the Komodo dragon, Gila monster, Mexican bearded lizard, iguana, and lace monitor.\nScientists originally thought that some of these lizards simply thought that the harmful bacteria in the saliva in their mouths gave them their toxicity, but recent studies have put more lizards in the category “venomous” than before.\nLizard venom is not as dangerous to humans as it is to animals who fall victim to a toxic lizard’s bite. Symptoms can include a sudden drop in blood pressure, loss of consciousness, hemorrhaging, kidney failure, nerve failure, and muscle breakdown, leading to the animal’s death.\nBehavior\nThe Komodo dragon is one of the largest lizards in the world today.\n©vladivlad/Shutterstock.com\nAlthough there are species that are plant-eaters at least in part, they are primarily predators who feed upon insects and other small creatures. Yet the largest lizard species, the Komodo Dragon of Indonesia , has been known to bring down and feed upon very large creatures such as water buffalo .\nCharacteristically, these lizards are generally classified as “sit and wait” hunters. This means that they take up station at a favorable place and then wait for their prey to come to them. Once a prospective victim comes within reach, they will either leap out and snap at it with their open jaws or use their long tongues to seize it and bring it into their mouth.\nApart from being a symbol of a mating call, they usually bob their heads as a way to look more intimidating to prey and predators. Males lead solitary lives and defend their chosen territorial hunting ranges from other males. Females can range freely but are often found in groups living in near proximity to a dominant male.\nDue to their ectothermic nature, lizards are well known for sunning themselves in warm areas. This raises their body temperature towards the optimum level and allows them to perform functions such as hunting, mating, or fighting at full capacity. These reptiles prefer to live in places that are easily defensible such as holes or rock crevasses.\nTheir scaly skin allows scant evaporation so lizards require very little water apart from the moisture they glean from their food or even from the licked-off dew accumulating on their own bodies. This makes them ideally suited for the desert conditions where many lizard species are found.\nLargest and Smallest Lizards\nThe Komodo dragon is the largest lizard in the world.\n©Anna Kucherova/Shutterstock.com\nThe largest lizard species in the world is the Komodo dragon which can measure 10 feet in length. The largest Komodo dragon on record weighed 365 pounds. Most of the largest lizard species are monitor lizards, but some iguana species can grow to be quite large as well. Blue iguanas weigh around 31 pounds and reach 5 feet in length.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the smallest lizard is the nano chameleon which measures less than an inch and lives in a small area of Madagascar. Incredibly, scientists first classified the nano chameleon as a species in 2021!\nThere are a number of extremely small chameleons on the northern end of Madagascar. It’s believed they shrunk as an adaptation to habitat loss.\nTypes Of Lizards\nWhile it would be impossible to provide an inclusive list of species everywhere, here are a few examples of the types of lizards that can be found in different parts of the globe.\nMonitor Lizard\nFound in Africa , Asia , and the island chains leading to and including Australia , there are more than 70 distinct species of monitor lizards. Monitors are the largest of the lizards and include the famous Komodo Dragon as well as such others as the Nile Monitor of Egypt and the Perentie of Australia .\nCaiman Lizard\nSouth America is home to the Caiman Lizard, which inhabits swampy lowlands and feeds primarily upon shelled creatures such as crayfish, freshwater clams, and snails. The Caiman lizard dumps these creatures into the back of its mouth, where its powerful jaws crush the shell of its prey. The broken shell is spat out and the soft parts of the creature are swallowed.\nFrilled Lizard\nThe famed Frilled Lizard is found in Australia and New Guinea . When in danger, the Frilled Lizard fans out the frill of skin that normally lays flat behind its neck and creates the illusion of a much larger and more menacing creature than it really is. It is also known for running on its hind legs with its tail and forelegs held in the air.\nArmadillo Lizard\nThe unique Armadillo Lizard is from South Africa . When in danger, it curls up and presents an armored ball that foils predators. Its overlapping scales give the appearance of it being a very tiny dragon. In addition, the Armadillo lizard is one of the few social reptiles that live in groups rather than as solitary hunters.\nSand Lizard\nNow protected from further habitat destruction, the UK’s rare Sand Lizard is found among sand dunes and on sandy outcroppings on the verge of heathlands. As with many other threatened species, increasing population density is the primary cause of its downfall.\nAdditionally, here is a list of other types of lizards:\nIguanas\nSkink\nMexican alligator lizard\nSpiny lizards\nWestern fence lizard\nBearded dragons\nMexican beaded lizard\nGila monster\nChameleons\nEastern collared lizard\nPlumed basilisk\nBasilisks\nAgamid lizards\nLeopard gecko\nAnoles\nSpiny-tailed lizards\nGlass lizards\nHorned lizards\nGerrhosauridae\nGreen anole\nTegus\nThorny devil\nIguanids\nChinese water dragon\nLacertidae\nGeckos\nIntellagama lesueurii\nEastern fence lizard\nSceloporus malachiticus\nBurton’s legless lizard\nWhiptails\nGiant girdled lizard\nTakydromus tachydromoides\nMosasaurus\nGekkota\nCrested gecko\nMosasaurs\nHabitat\nThese reptiles inhabit every continent on Earth except for Antarctica . Certain species have been found in far northern reaches above the Arctic Circle and others at the inhospitable southern tip of South America .\nWith thousands of species on the planet, there are lizards adapted for virtually all environmental and climatic conditions. In regions where their food sources are abundant, such as in tropical jungles, they can attain very large sizes. In places of limited supplies, smaller species tend to predominate.\nThere are lizards that prefer living in trees while others inhabit open areas where large quantities of sunshine are readily obtainable. Most of these reptiles are daylight species although there are a few night-specific lizards such as the gecko and one species, the Galapagos Marine Iguana, which lives primarily in the ocean.\nDiet\nLizards mostly eat insects, but some species can also eat rodents, frogs, birds, and other lizards and reptiles.\n©A-Z-Animals.com\nLizards are largely predatory in nature and are often so-called “sit and wait” hunters who remain motionless until their prey comes within reach. At this point, they dart out and grab it in a surprise attack before it can escape.\nWhat do lizards eat?\nMost lizards are carnivorous and feed upon insects , ants , and other invertebrates. Larger lizard species feed upon small animals such as mice and other rodents, and snails . Still larger species such as the monitor lizards can prey upon much larger quarries such as frogs , birds , fish , larger mammals , and even snakes .\nAround 2% of lizard species are primarily vegetarians as adults, although younger members will eat meat and then gradually adopt a vegan diet as they reach adulthood. Fruit is often eaten even by carnivorous species, and bird and reptile eggs are frequently sought by larger lizards.\nPredators and Threats\nIn nature, animal species must balance their own need to feed against the need of other species to use them as a food source. Just as predatory lizards are always on the hunt, so too are other predators searching for them.\nHuman Predators\nHumans are one of these reptiles’ biggest predators. Some see lizards as pests so they constantly try to get rid of them, especially in residential environments. It’s advisable to get rid of lizards using humane methods instead of killing them since some species are endangered already.\nWhat eats lizards?\nLarge birds such as hawks are the primary threat to most lizard species.\n©RJ Ridley/Shutterstock.com\nDue to a lizard’s ability to move very swiftly when in danger, most lizard predators need to be fast-moving themselves.\nLarge birds such as hawks are the primary threat to most lizard species. Their keen eyesight allows them to detect movement from very far away. This leads to lizard defenses such as changing colors to match terrain and remaining absolutely motionless in exposed locations.\nMost canine and feline species, certainly including dogs and domestic cats , will eat lizards.\nAlthough not dependent upon lizards as their primary food source, the swiftly-striking mongoose is well-suited for hunting lizards.\nJust as lizards eat snakes , so too do snakes return the favor and eat lizards. Larger lizards are also known to prey upon smaller species.\nThe regal jumping spider, weighing in at only 2-3 gms, has been known to capture lizards more than three times its own size.\nSince lizard meat is often considered to be a delicacy in some cultures, humans are the ultimate apex predator for lizards. This is particularly true of the iguana, which is prized for its meaty tail.\nEnvironmental Threats\nSince the vast array of species are generally engineered for life in a specific environmental zone and they are ectothermic, climate change can offer a serious threat to many species by either unfavorably altering the heat balance of the region or severely decreasing their preferred food supply.\nHuman-created sprawl also invades prime lizard habitats via such things as urbanization or deforestation. This can also lead to increases in predator population brought about by nearby habitat disruption of another species. This brings a large number of threatened species into a formerly balanced ecosystem. As human populations continue to grow, additional pressure is placed upon those lizards which are considered to be a human food source.\nThreatened Lizard Species\nThe Tarzan Chameleon has been nearly wiped out by habitat destruction of forest cover in favor of agricultural development.\n©FEDERICA21/Shutterstock.com\nIn a rapidly altering world, it is estimated that nearly 20% of all reptile species, which includes lizards, are threatened to one degree or another. Among the most severely at risk are:\nThe Tarzan Chameleon of Madagascar, scientific name Calumma tarzani , is generally green or yellow but adopts a striped pattern when threatened. The Tarzan Chameleon has been nearly wiped out by habitat destruction of forest cover in favor of agricultural development and gold mining in the region.\nThe Jamaican Rock Iguana, scientific name Cyclura collei , was actually believed to be extinct until a small colony was rediscovered in 1990. Currently numbering only about 100 individuals, the Jamaican Rock Iguana population collapsed by being hunted for food and faced with human-sponsored habitat invasion through the introduction of non-native predators such as dogs and pigs into the area. Human development activity in the region also reduces and degrades its remaining habitat potential.\nReproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nBaby Lazarus Lizard (Podarcis muralis) held in a person’s hands.\n©Furiarossa/Shutterstock.com\nNo one rule completely covers these reptiles’ reproduction methods.\nThe majority of species use male sperm fertilization of a female’s internal eggs as a method of reproduction. In general, these eggs are laid in a safe place and abandoned thereafter, although some species employ females to brood upon the eggs until hatching.\nAbout 1 out of every 5 types employ viviparity or live birth from eggs developed inside the female body and then born as functional members of the species rather than being hatched from eggs laid outside the body.\nA few species reproduce via parthenogenesis or reproduction from eggs that do not require male fertilization. In rare cases, this has even been known to occur in non-parthenogenic lizard species where the female does not have access to a male.\nWhen it comes to the sex selection of the embryo, the eggs are known to be temperature-dependent in some cases. High temperatures during incubation produce more females and vice versa in low-temperature conditions.\nThe number of eggs laid by the female can vary from 5 percent of body weight up to as much as 50 percent. Depending on the size of eggs in the particular species, this can result in a clutch of as many as 50 small eggs or as few as a single large one.\nOnce laid, most eggs hatch within about 3 months’ time. Upon birth, the infants have no family life. They are totally on their own as miniature versions of the adult they will eventually grow into.\nMake sure to read our complete guide on baby lizards called ‘ What’s a Baby Lizard Called + 4 More Amazing Facts .’\nPopulation\nIt is impossible to say how many lizards there are in the world. Some severely endangered species have been counted as part of their protection and recovery effort.\nIt is almost certainly true that the number of lizards overall continues to decline even as the number of identified lizard species continues to climb.\nLizards In The Zoo\nSouth Dakota might seem an unlikely place to find the world’s largest reptile zoo. Located 6 miles south of Rapid City, Reptile Gardens is officially the place.\nZoo Miami is located in the heart of the reptile country and is a great place for the family to visit.\nAnother underappreciated zoo is the Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium in Omaha, which boasts both the world’s largest indoor desert and largest indoor rain forest.\nOrigin and Evolution of Lizards\nUntil the 13th century, lizards were categorized under the broad umbrella of reptiles, which included snakes, amphibians, and worms that laid eggs. In the early seventeenth century, James Macartney used the term Sauria, adapted from Sauriens which was coined by Alexandre Brongniart to describe a class of reptiles that were essentially lizards and crocodiles.\nAlthough the denomination may be new, however, the origin of lizards is not. The earliest known lizard fossil, Tikiguania belonging to the iguanian species, was found in the Tiki Formation in India. However, there is doubt about the age of the fossil since it resembles modern-day agamid lizards.\nThey are related to Rhynchocephalia, an order of lizards whose only living species is the tuatara found in New Zealand.\nLizards and Human\nLizards have been a source of fascination due to their unique abilities specific to each species, such as the ability to grow lost limbs, blend in with the environment, see 360 degrees, climb vertically and stick to the ceilings upside down, walk on water and asexual reproduction.\nThey have been studied through the ages to determine if these qualities can be deciphered. Although they look scary, lizards are mostly harmless to humans, with the exception of Comodo Dragons who have been known to stalk and attack humans.\nDespite all of the drawbacks, lizards are quite popular as pets. Especially the bearded dragons, chameleons, geckos, iguanas, monitors, tegu, and green anoles are some of the species that are popular as pets.\nView all 93 animals that start with L\nAbout the Author\nRebecca\nMy name is Rebecca and I've been a Professional Freelancer for almost a decade.

When catching a lizard , first look to identify it. Remember that there are only 3 truly venomous lizards in the world – the Gila monster, Mexican beaded dragon, and Komodo dragon. Both beaded lizards and Gila monsters may be found in the Southwest of the United States. Once you’ve identified it, use supplies like thick leather gloves or a container to capture it. Finally, you can set a trap to capture it before releasing it into the wild.\nAre lizards poisonous?\nNo lizards are poisonous, but some are venomous . A few examples include the Gila monster, the Mexican beaded lizard, and the Komodo dragon\nHow do you keep lizards away?\nLizards can be kept away with a number of household repellents such as hot sauce, garlic, coffee grounds, and citrus. In addition, you can keep entry points to your home clean and lawns well-maintained to avoid too many lizards.\nWhat's the difference between lizards and salamanders?\nSalamanders and lizards can often look very similar . The key difference is that lizards can live in a variety of environments while salamanders require being closer to water. In addition, salamanders have a “moist” appearance and lack claws and earholes.\nAre Lizards herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores?\nLizards are Omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and other animals.\nWhat Kingdom do Lizards belong to?\nLizards belong to the Kingdom Animalia.\nWhat class do Lizards belong to?\nLizards belong to the class Reptilia.\nWhat phylum to Lizards belong to?\nLizards belong to the phylum Chordata.\nWhat family do Lizards belong to?\nLizards belong to the family Lacertidae.\nWhat order do Lizards belong to?\nLizards belong to the order Squamata.\nWhat type of covering do Lizards have?\nLizards are covered in Scales.\nIn what type of habitat do Lizards live?\nLizards live in warm forests and deserts worldwide.\nWhat is the main prey for Lizards?\nLizards prey on insects, birds, and small rodents.\nWhat are some predators of Lizards?\nPredators of Lizards include humans, birds, and snakes.\nHow many babies do Lizards have?\nThe average number of babies a Lizard has is 18.\nWhat is an interesting fact about Lizards?\nThere are around 7,000 different species of Lizard!\nWhat is the lifespan of a Lizard?\nLizards can live for 1 to 30 years.\nDo lizards make good pets?\nThe facts are that some do and some don’t. Iguanas are often good pets since they are docile plant-eaters. Komodo Dragons are not good pets since they are vile-tempered meat-eaters that outweigh you by more than 2-1.\nAre house lizards harmful to humans?\nNot particularly. The main risk comes from salmonella, which some lizards may have in their bodies. On the other hand, they eat ants, termites, and other insects which might be more of an annoyance.\nAre lizards good to have around your house?\nMost people would be disturbed by swiftly skittering wild creatures zipping around at unexpected times and places. As a wild creature, they are probably best kept outside. As family pets kept in a herbarium, they are not a big problem.\nHow do you catch a lizard?\nA simple string noose lowered gently around its head from in front will often do the trick. Another interesting idea is to put some plastic film over an open box. Cut a slit in the plastic for the lizard to fall through and place some kind of lizard-friendly food on top. The lizard gets up to eat the food, then falls through the slit and is captured.\nWhat is the lifespan of lizards?\nThat depends on the species and whether they are in the wild or in captivity as pets or exhibits. Some common lizard species lifespans:\nChameleon – 5-7 years\nGekko – 10-15 years\nIguana – 20 years\nKomodo Dragon – 40 years\nHow do Lizards have babies?\nLizards lay eggs.\nWhat's the difference between chameleons and lizards?\nThe greatest differences between a chameleon and a lizard are their tails, eyes, and tongues. Chameleons are known for their unique prehensile tails, and they are one of the few reptiles that possess them.\nWhat Does Lizard Poop Look Like?\nLizard poop , it turns out, has a very distinct appearance–one you’re likely not to forget once you’ve seen it. It typically has a long brown or black pellet-shaped portion with a smaller, semi-solid white “cap” or substance at the end. While the brown portion is the lizard’s poop, the white part is essentially the lizard’s urine.\n \nHow long do lizards live?\nIn the wild, a lizard’s average lifespan is no more than 3-5 years. However, when living in captivity as pets, lizards are able to live anywhere between 20-50 years of age!\n \nThank you for reading! Have some feedback for us?

The second-largest continent after Asia, it is home to many beautiful and dangerous animals of various sizes, both diurnal and nocturnal.\nThese include mammals , reptiles , birds , and insects , with many being unique to Africa. Because of its biodiversity, it is a popular location for animal researchers as well as safari enthusiasts. It contains over 1,100 different mammal species, plus over 60 carnivore species, 100,000 insect species, 3,000 freshwater fish species, and over 2,600 bird species. Its populations of insects comprise 15-20% of all insects in the world.\nWatch on YouTube\nThe Official National Animals of Africa\nSince Africa is made up of several countries containing their own culture and languages, as well as different types of habitats, there aren’t official African animals that represent the entire continent. Hence, each country has its own official national animal, with some countries having more than one national animal or sharing the same national animal as that of other countries.\nThe Oryx is the National Animal of Namibia\n©WOLF AVNI/Shutterstock.com\nNational animals are often categorized according to type, especially if a country has more than one. For example, the Leopard is the official national animal (land mammal) of both Rwanda and Somalia , while the American Fish Eagle is the national bird of Namibia and Zambia , and the Oryx is the national animal of Namibia. South Africa’s official national animal is the Springbok , its national bird is the Blue Crane, and its national fish is the Galjoen.\nThe Top African Wildlife\nThe top wild African animals are those that people most often seek out in safaris, with many being animals native to Africa. These safari animals are housed in national parks, game reserves, and other sanctuaries for both human safety as well as to avoid their becoming part of extinct animals in Africa. Among the best-known African animals are the “ Big Five ” which are the Lion , Leopard , Elephant , Rhinoceros, and Buffalo .\nWhat makes these five animals so popular is the fact they have historically been the most hunted African animals by professional hunters and poachers alike. All five are known to be dangerous and challenging to track. Black rhinos are one of the most elusive animals of the Big Five and are also the rarest. Poachers have hunted them to near extinction, believing their horns have medicinal properties. Only 5,000 of them remain in the wild, so it is a treat indeed to spot one. Cape buffalos are the most dangerous of the mix due to their unpredictability. Leopards are a rare sight because they are nocturnal, and also run away when they sense or see humans near them. Lions are camouflaged by the tall savannah grasses when they are hunting prey by day, so are challenging to spot by the untrained eye. And elephants have been hunted for their ivory tusks to the point of being critically endangered. They are also the largest land mammals on the planet, which lends to their popularity.\nRhinos are one of the “Big Five” African Land Animals\n©Henk Bogaard/Shutterstock.com\nAll of the Big Five animals can be seen in South Africa and are native animals:\nLion: Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park bordering South Africa, Namibia and Botswana; Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park during the wildebeest migration.\nLeopard: South Africa’s Sabi Sands Game Reserve and Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park .\nElephant: Zimbabwe’s Hwange National Park and Botswana’s Chobe National Park .\nRhinoceros: White Rhinos in South Africa’s Hluhluwe–Imfolozi Park and Kruger National Park ; Black Rhinos in Namibia’s Etosha National Park and Kenya’s Ol Pejeta Conservancy .\nBuffalo: Tanzania’s Katavi National Park and Botswana’s Chobe National Park .\nFinding Top Wild African Animals\nIf you are planning a special trip to view Africa’s diverse variety of wildlife, the question of where to travel to view them is an important one to ask. There are particular areas of Africa that are very popular as African safari destinations. These countries/areas include:\nBotswana – It has a variety of national parks and a modern approach to wildlife conservation.\nKenya – Probably the most popular country to visit for safaris with 25 national parks, 16 national reserves, 6 marine parks and reserves, and more.\nMalawai – Though a very small country, it houses Lake Malawi National Park, which covers about a third of the country. This biodiverse lake region features 200 mammal species (including big cats, elephants, hippos, monkeys, and more), 650 species of bird, and over 5,500 plants.\nNamibia – It’s one of the least populated countries in the world, but has 12 national parks, plus other reserves and protected areas one can explore.\nRwanda – Besides offering many opportunities to view the Big 5, there are 10 habituated gorilla families in Rwanda’s Volcanoes National Park. Tours allow groups of 8 to view these gorillas in their habitat, which is a life-changing experience.\nSouth Africa – It’s one of the most affordable destinations for safaris due to the development of major city hubs like Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Durban. Tourists can find cheaper accommodations and touring packages.\nTanzania – This country ranks only 2nd to Kenya in popularity due to its 16 national parks, 3 game reserves, and 2 marine reserves. One can also witness the famous wildebeest migration.\nUganda – It’s home to 365 mammal species, 1100 bird species, and Africa’s tallest mountain range. Tourists can also view the largest free-standing volcano in the world, the second-largest freshwater lake, and the headwaters of the world’s longest river.\nZambia – This country is increasing in popularity because of conservation efforts, improvement in its economy and infrastructure, and its beautiful 20 national parks.\nZimbabwe – While its reputation was tarnished by the dictator Robert Mugabe since he was ousted in 2017, tourism has improved in this country. It’s home to Victoria Falls, as well as up to 100 species of mammals (including endangered Cape wild dogs) and 400 species of birds.\nZebras are found in the Serengeti or Masai Mara region\nThe Best Locations by Animal:\nGiraffe : Masai giraffes in the Serengeti region; Rothschild’s giraffe in Uganda’s Murchison Falls National Park .\nCheetah : Kenya’s Masai Mara National Reserve and Namibia’s Okonjima Game Reserve .\nHippopotamus : Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park and the Okavango Delta in Botswana.\nCrocodile : Nile crocodiles can be seen in the Mara River of East Africa during the annual migration of wildebeests and zebras.\nZebra : The Serengeti region or the Masai Mara during migration season; Grévy’s Zebra in northern Kenya’s Lewa Wildlife Conservancy .\nWild Dog : Tanzania’s Ruaha National Park , South Africa’s Madikwe Game Reserve, and Zimbabwe’s Hwange National Park .\nThe Most Dangerous African Animals Today\nLand animals in Africa are popular attractions for safari enthusiasts, although they are not always treated with caution and respect. Many dangerous African animals are among the most dangerous in the world after human beings, whether hostile or poisonous. It’s of the utmost importance to research the most reputable safaris so that your safety is relatively sure. In general, it’s rare to go get injured on an African safari, though possible–the chances are roughly 1 in 80,000. While elephants and hippos are considered the most dangerous, lions and leopards are also animals to be cautious of when touring.\nThe riskiest type of activity is the walking safari. You should only go out with a trained guide, who may or may not be armed. If he is not, it is typical for an armed park ranger to also be present. If the guide seems unprofessional, it is advisable to back out of the excursion.\nFortunately, the most dangerous African animals can be safely seen in national parks and game reserves. The top 10 most dangerous African animals and their estimated number of human deaths per year are:\nHippos are highly aggressive and unpredictable, and often charge other animals or even humans.\n©iStock.com/mesut zengin\nMosquito : Causes diseases including Malaria, Yellow Fever, Zeka Virus, West Nile Virus, and Dengue Fever; 1,000,000 deaths.\nHippopotamus : Territorial and weighs up to 1,500kg, making it the third-largest animal after the elephant and rhino; 3,000 deaths.\nAfrican Elephant : Largest land animal; weighs up to 7,000kg and is unpredictable; tramples victims; 500 deaths.\nNile Crocodile : Aggressive, fatal attacks; 300 deaths.\nLion : Apex predator; kills locals during their daily lives or on the fringes of game reserves; 200 deaths.\nCape Buffalo : Nicknamed “widowmaker” and “black death”; fearless, aggressive, and unpredictable; will stalk and kill humans if alone; tramples and gores victims to death; weighs up to 1,000kg; 200 deaths.\nGreat White Shark : Most aggressive shark towards humans; charges at prey up to 40km an hour before taking a large bite; humans die from blood loss in 20 percent of cases; 2 deaths.\nRhinoceros : Weighs up to 2,800kg and second largest animal after the elephant; irritable, and charges with long, sharp horns up to 64km an hour when threatened; unknown.\nPuff Adder : Not the most venomous snake but causes the most fatalities due to its wide habitat range, camouflage colors, and aggressiveness; 20 percent fatality rate from untreated bites; unknown.\nBlack Mamba: Largest venomous snake in Africa, growing up to 2.5m; one of the world’s fastest snakes, moving at 20km an hour; highly aggressive; one of the most venomous snakes in the world with a 100% fatality for untreated bites; unknown.\nEndangered Animals In Africa\nAn African Wild Dog at Savuti, Chobe National Park, Botswana.\n©Derek Keats / Flickr\nSeveral species are endangered or vulnerable due to hunting and poaching, particularly large and dangerous animals which are prized as trophies. Endangered animals in Africa include the Black Rhino , White Rhino , Rothschild’s Giraffe , Grévy’s Zebra , (African) Wild Dog , Grey Crowned Crane , and Okapi. Additionally, the Lion, Leopard, Cheetah, and African Forest elephants are vulnerable species.\nBringing these animals back from the point of extinction can be a very difficult process. For example, the Cross River gorilla, a subspecies of the Western gorilla which inhabits the border region in Cameroon and Nigeria, went down to a population 200-300. Female Cross River gorillas only breed 3-4 times in their lifespan and give birth an average of every 4-6 years. This makes their recovery long and tedious, and their protection from poachers and other factors is all-important.\nBirds in Africa\nThere are many different types of birds in Africa. In fact, there are 2,341 species of native African birds, and 25 of those species are endemic, meaning you can’t find them anywhere else. Some of the most exotic African birds include the lilac breasted roller, brown snake eagle, Cape Glossy starling, marabou stork, and the African white backed vulture.\nOstriches are one of the most popular birds to view in Africa. This group was pictured in Kgalagadi, South Africa.\n©bruna-nature/Shutterstock.com\nYou can find birds all over the African continent. A few iconic species include:\nShoebill : These massive birds are found in swamps and wetlands of Central and East Africa. Shoebills don’t migrate and spend their days hunting in papyrus swamps. You can find them in the Bangweulu Wetlands in northeastern Zambia.\nGuinea fowl : There are 6 species of guinea fowl in Africa. They are found across the continent in a variety of habitats.\nSecretary bird: Found in sub-Saharan Africa, these birds of prey prefer to hunt on the ground. It is common to see them in Kgalagadi   Transfrontier Park .\nCommon Ostrich : Perhaps Africa’s most well-known bird species. Breeding season is the best time to see large flocks of Ostriches, from March to September. They are found in the savannas, woodlands, and deserts of Southern Africa and across Western Africa to the horn of Africa. They can be seen in many African parks and game reserves, including Kruger National Park and Chobe National Park .\nAfrican Penguins : You can see African penguins along the southeastern coast of Africa and surrounding islands. The best time to see them is from November to August. They are most active at dusk and dawn. A popular viewing destination for African penguins is Boulders Beach in Simons Town, South Africa.\nHornbills : There are 24 species of hornbill found in Africa. You can see arboreal and terrestrial species in African savannas, rainforests, and woodlands. Find Southern Ground Hornbills in Mapungubwe or Kruger National Park.\nTypes of African Fish\nThe African Great Lakes have high populations of cichlids, such as the Strawberry Peacock African Malawi Cichlid.\n©Grigorev Mikhail/Shutterstock.com\nAfrica is home to an abundance of freshwater and marine fish. There are hundreds of freshwater lakes and rivers in Africa. Some of the most notable are the African Great Lakes, a system of 7 lakes in East, South, and Central Africa. These lakes are known for their cichlid populations. One of the great lakes, Lake Malawi is an especially popular fishing destination, with over 1,000 species of fish. Fishing in Lake Malawi is best between September and April, but underwater viewing is best between May and October.\nWith Western Africa bordering the Atlantic Ocean, and Eastern Africa the Indian Ocean, you will easily find thousands of marine fish species. Kenya, Tanzania, and Zanzibar are popular fishing destinations where you can catch several species of tuna , sharks, mackerel, marlin, barracuda , and more. The best time for deep-sea fishing off these coasts is between October and April. If you’re interested in viewing marine wildlife, Mozambique has a marine conservation area where you can enjoy manta rays , sharks, eels, and a variety of reef fish. October to March is the best time for snorkeling in Mozambique.\nSnakes in Africa\nA wide variety of snakes call Africa home. There are snakes in every type of habitat, from tropical, to desert, to aquatic. You’ll find both venomous and non-venomous snakes in Africa. Venomous snakes in Africa have three different types of venom- Cytotoxic, neurotoxic, and haemotoxic. Cytotoxins kill cells. They destroy the cells in soft tissue and internal organs. Neurotoxins affect neural pathways and can cause paralysis. Haemotixins destroy red blood cells and prevent blood from clotting.\nThe puff adder resides throughout sub-Saharan Africa in open forests, grasslands, and rocky savannahs.\n©iStock.com/S_Lew\nSome of the deadliest snakes in Africa include:\nBlack Mamba : Africa’s longest snake, and one of the fastest snakes in the world. Black mambas are found in Southern and Eastern Africa. They live in savannahs and rocky hills.\nBoomslang : One of the most venomous snakes in the world. Native to the savannahs of sub-Saharan Africa.\nBush Viper : Arboreal snakes found in the tropical rainforests of Western and Central Africa.\nCape Cobra : Only found in Southern Africa. They live in a variety of habitats, like grasslands, savannahs, and deserts.\nWest African Carpet Viper : Endemic to the dry savannahs of West Africa. It is the most dangerous snake in Africa.\nEastern Green Mamba: Arboreal snakes native to the coastal regions of Southern and East Africa. They can be found in the dense vegetation of tropical rainforests.\nPuff Adder : Found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, typically in open forests, grasslands, and rocky savannahs.\nA few nonvenomous snakes native to Africa :\nBall Python: Live north of the equator in Western and Central Africa. They are found near water in grasslands and forests.\nBrown House Snake: Distributed throughout Southern Africa. These snakes are popular as pets.\nSpotted Bush Snake: Found in a variety of habitats close to water sources. They have a large range, from Southern Africa northward into Central Africa, from east to west coasts.\nAfrican Rock Python: The largest snake in Africa. Native to sub-Saharan Africa, in a range of habitats near permanent bodies of water.\nThe 6 Rarest African Animals\nAside from the Big 5, there are innumerable African animals that can be viewed in their natural habitats. But there are some animals that are very rare to witness, so any traveler who should happen upon one would be lucky. Here’s a look at 6 very rare African animals to see:\nMountain gorillas, which are critically endangered, would be one of the rarest animal groups to witness in Africa.\n©Marian Galovic/Shutterstock.com\nPangolin : This pre-historic-looking animal, which sports armor-like scales, is an elusive nocturnal creature whose main dietary staple is ants. Of the eight subspecies existent in the world, four inhabit Africa including the black-bellied pangolin, white-bellied pangolin, giant ground pangolin, and Temminck’s ground pangolin. All these types are listed as threatened.\nBlack Rhino : With only 5,000 left in the wild, the critically endangered black rhinocerus would be a prized sight to behold. Kruger National Park in South Africa would be one of the best places to witness this rare African animal.\nHoney Badger : The star of the hilarious viral video “Honey Badger Don’t Care,” this skunk-like, tough-as-nails animal fearlessly takes on dangerous animals like cobras and lions. While the honey badger is not endangered, it’s still a rare animal to witness on a safari. It inhabits dry areas, and one popular spot to view them is Etosha National Park in Namibia.\nEthiopian Wolf : This large canine is the most endangered carnivore in Africa, with fewer than 440 individuals remaining. It’s endemic to Ethiopia’s highlands, restricted to just seven isolated enclaves in the region. As Africa’s only wolf species, witnessing one would be marvelous. Bale Mountain National Park would be the best place to see one.\nMountain Gorilla : Bwindi National Park in Uganda would be the place to see this rare, most endangered animal species in Africa. Also known as siverbacks, these animals are found in the forested regions of mountain habitats between 8,000 and 13,000 feet up. Given there are only 1,000 left in the world, it’s one of the rarest and most treasured animals to view in Africa.\nAfrican Penguin : It’s the only penguin subspecies to inhabit Africa, and also one of the most endangered African animals. These adorable birds live on the south-western coast, living in 27 colonies on 24 islands between Namibia and Algoa Bay, near Port Elizabeth, South Africa, with the largest colony found on Dyer Island, near Kleinbaai.\nThe 5 Largest African Animals\nA giant among African wildlife, the African elephant is the largest land mammal on earth.\nAfrica is home to some of the largest land animals on the planet including the world’s tallest and heaviest mammals. Here’s our list of the top 5 animals who impress with their enormous sizes:\nAfrican Elephant : African elephants takes the top prize in several categories. Besides being the largest land animals on earth with an average weight of 4-8 tons and height of 10 feet tall, these giants are also among the strongest in the world, capable of lifting 7 tons of weight. Elephants are also incredibly smart.\nWhite Rhinoceros : The white rhino is considered the second largest land animal in the world, with a maximum weight of 4 tons! It can stand up to 6 feet tall, and is a highly dangerous animal to encounter in the wild.\nHippopotamus : Hippos can grow up to 16 feet long, weigh up to 4.5 tons, and sport teeth measuring 20 inches long, which they use for fighting as well as eating. This third-largest African animal may appear docile, but should be feared, as it’s another very dangerous mammal.\nGiraffe : Weighing up to 3,000 lbs, giraffes measure the tallest of any land animal on earth at an average height of 18 feet. Their stand-out feature is their ultra-long necks, which allow them to eat foliage in trees as well as graze.\nAfrican Buffalo : This species of buffalo, native to Africa, can weigh as much as 3,5000 lbs and its length can reach over 11 feet.\nRivers in Africa\nThere are numerous massive rivers in Africa that are home to a variety of wildlife and African animals. African rivers range from the Nile River, which stretches more than 4,000 miles in length and is a haven of wildlife in the harshness of the Sahara Desert to the Okavango River, which has an inland delta that covers 600,000 acres in swamps and floods during dry seasons to create a gathering ground for thousands of animals.\nThe Nile River is the longest in Africa, and home to countless native African animals.\n©iStock.com/Phototreat\nThese rivers are rich habitats for diverse African wildlife. Many large herds of safari animals can be viewed near these rivers like elephants, giraffes, antelope, and hundreds of bird species. Other animals include gorillas, hippos, Nile crocodiles, hundreds of fish species, and even hyenas and African wild dogs.\nSome notable African rivers include:\nCongo River: The second longest river in Africa with a length of 2,900 miles. At measured depths of 219.5 meters, it’s also the world’s deepest recorded river. Nearly 800 fish species have been recorded inhabiting the Congo River Basin, and its tropical forests are home to mammals like the bonobo, Allen’s swamp monkey, the aquatic genet, okapi, the dryas monkey, and Congo peafowl.\nNiger River: The main river of West Africa, it flows 2,590 miles from southeastern Guinea through Mali, Niger, and Benin, and empties in the massive Niger Delta into the Gulf of Guinea. This river’s course is unique, having the appearance of a boomerang in shape. Animals found along the Niger include hippopotamuses, several types of crocodiles including the Nile crocodile, and numerous species of lizards and birds.\nOrange River: Flows 1,300 miles across South Africa and forms the boundary with Namibia. The Orange River is home to a number of endemic fish including the Numaquab barb, Maluti redfin, and Orange River mudfish.\nZambezi River: A massive 2,200 miles river that is home to Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.

We currently track 1017 animals in the United States and are adding more every day!\nThe list of indigenous United States animals is long and includes well-known creatures like coyotes and raccoons and lesser-known animals like the glass lizard and adorable pika. The incredible 2,972 estimated animals native to the United States make it one of only\n17 megadiverse countries in the world. The United States features over 400 known mammals, nearly 800 birds, over 300 reptiles, nearly 300 amphibians , and over 1,100 fish species!\nThe Two National Animals Of The United States\nThe American Bison was declared the national mammal of the United States on May 9, 2016. \n©Tim Malek/Shutterstock.com\nSurprisingly, the United States is one of a few countries that has TWO national animals. The first is the well-known\nBald Eagle . Once on the verge of extinction , the Bald Eagle population has rebounded in recent years and is widely considered the ultimate success of the Endangered Species Act. \nOriginally, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams were tasked with choosing a new seal for the nascent United States, but after failing to do so, the responsibility fell to Charles Thomson, the secretary of Congress. Thomson made an American Bald eagle sketch, originally holding an olive branch and arrows in each talon, these represented the power of peace and war. His design was accepted and the Bald Eagle became the national bird of the United States on September 16, 1782.\nThe second United States national animal is the\nAmerican Bison , the largest land mammal in North America. The American Bison was declared the national mammal of the United States much more recently, on May 9, 2016. \nOnce abundant across the country with millions spanning all across North America, the American Bison population once fell as low as a few hundred. After aggressive conservation efforts total populations have rebounded but still remain near threatened today. There are 17 known bison herds in the United States that number about 10,000 today. \nOther countries with more than one national animal include\nAustralia ,\nthe Bahamas , and\nCanada .\nWhere to Find The Top Wild Animals In the United States\nIf you want a chance to see a grey wolf in the U.S., visit Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks.\n©AB Photographie/Shutterstock.com\nWith so much land area and so many different environments, the list of animals native to the USA is long and diverse. Here is a list of where you can see some of the most famous wild animals in the United States.\nBald Eagle – After a resurgence in the population Bald Eagles can now be found in many US states, most commonly near bodies of water like reservoirs, rivers, lakes , and coastal waters. The Klamath Basin Refuges in California is home to the largest known concentration of Bald Eagles, with up to 1,000 birds present there.\nAmerican Bison – With a herd of nearly 5,000, Yellowstone National Park is the best place to see American Bison in the United States. The Lamar and Hayden Valleys are the most consistent area of bison sightings. The National Bison Range in Montana is another good place to view American Bison\nGrey Wolves – Grey Wolves are hard to spot in the United States. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates the total population at around 13,000, including Alaska. For the best chance of a grey wolf sighting in the US visit Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks.\nBeaver – The semiaquatic American Beaver is found in most US states near rivers, marshes, ponds, and other slow-moving bodies of water. They are most active at night and can frequently be heard slapping their tails to warn of danger before they can be seen.\nAmerican Black Bear – The most widely distributed bear species in the United States the black bear is a common sight in trees forests, swamps, and mountains, particularly in the northeastern part of the United States. Though, black bears can also be found through the midwest, rocky mountain region, and as far south as Georgia.\nCougar – The North American cougar can be found in the Western United States and parts of Florida. After spartan populations for many years, cougars are also starting to rebound in parts of the US midwest. Though the animal is not endangered, populations are low and sightings are rare.\nThe Most Dangerous Animals In the United States Today\nBears’ muscular build, heavy body, sharp claws, and ability to run makes it an animal to be feared and respected.\n©AndreAnita/Shutterstock.com\nWhile many of the US animals are non-threatening, there are a few dangerous ones as well. The most dangerous animals in the USA include:\nKiller Bees – estimated to have killed 1,000 people in recent decades. Killer Bees are not actually a naturally occurring type of bee, but the result of a hybrid bee created by Biologist Warwick E. Kerr. Imported in the 1950s, these bees are significantly more aggressive than other bee types and have been known to chase humans for long distances when defending their hives\nGrizzly bears – Grizzlys cause an average of 3 fatal attacks in the United States each year, despite being largely isolated to Alaska and the northwestern part of the United States. But the enormous size of bears at nearly 500 pounds, surprising speeds of up to 35mph, and the highly protective instincts of mother bears make them a very deadly creature to cross when cubs are near. \nBlack Widow Spiders – Black widows are abundant throughout the United States. In 2013 alone there were 1,866 reported bites alone. While only a minority of bites are deadly, the powerful neurotoxins can still be damaging. Symptoms include cramping, headaches, fever, and nausea. \nRattlesnakes – Rattlesnakes can be found all over North America, the midwest, and The United States. There are an estimated 5 deaths and 7,000 – 8,000 reported bites by rattlesnakes in the US every year. As human populations expand the number of rattlesnakes and human encounters is increasing dramatically. Fortunately, there is a nearly guaranteed survival rate from a rattlesnake bite if anti-venom is administered within two hours.\nThe 7 Rarest Animals in the United States\nThe Florida panther is the only species from the puma family that lives in the U.S.\n©U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Southeast Region / Flickr\nWith so many animals in the United States for centuries, some have become endangered and on the verge of extinction. Here are the top 7 rarest animals you will see in the United States:\nFlorida Panther — This animal is the only species from the puma family that breeds in the United States. Florida panthers are easily the most dominant land predators in their home range. They can run up to 35 miles per hour and can leap more than 15 feet. This animal was one of the first listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1973.\nRed Wolf — This wolf species is native to the southeastern United States, though its habitat once extended from Texas in the west down to Florida and up into the Midwest. There are only 100 red wolves left in the wild, making it one of the rarest in the world. Its size is between the coyote and the gray wolf, its close cousin.\nFlorida Manatee — Though they are called called sea cows, the Florida manatee more closely relates to an elephant. While they don’t have many natural predators, humans are a huge threat to these creatures. Florida manatees spend much of their time grazing on vegetation in shallow water and can eat as much as 10% to 15% of their body weight each day.\nBlack-Footed Ferret — These solitary animals are actually big talkers! They communicate with one another by chattering, hissing, and whining. You probably won’t see them often as they sleep 21 hours each day and are only active at night. Their habitat is Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, and Arizona, and their main food group is prairie dogs.\nLoggerhead Sea Turtle — This sea turtle species is the world’s largest hard-shelled turtle. The largest ever seen weighed 1,202 lbs. They are widespread throughout the world, but as far as the U.S., they make their home in the southern Atlantic ocean around Florida, Georgia, and North & South Carolina.\nMississippi Gopher Frog — Also called the dusky gopher frog, it is only found in the state of Mississippi. There are only about 100-250 members of the population left in the wild. Sadly, this amphibian is almost extinct, and conservationists are making big strides to bring the population of this frog back.\nWoodland Caribou — Often called reindeer, these animals live in Washington state and Idaho. Surpisingly both males and females have antlers and their fur color largely depends on where they live. The reason for their endangered status has to do with being hunted often for their meat.\nThe 5 Largest Animals in the United States\nThe American alligator can move up to 15 mph on land!\n©iStock.com/Cindy Larson\nThe United States has some pretty big animals, as we have mentioned above. Do you know the largest animals in this country? Here are 5:\nBlue Whale — Tipping the scales at 448,000 pounds, the blue whale’s tongue alone can weigh as much as an adult elephant! It is the largest animal in the world. However, it is usually harmless to humans, instead eating krill, up to 8,000 pounds of them per day.\nGreat White Shark — These sharks are the largest predatory fish species in the world, known to grow to more than 26 feet long, weigh more than 4,000 pounds, and swim up to 15 mph. The great white shark is often called a “man-eater” because up to half of the annual shark attacks on humans reportedly are caused by this species.\nAlaska Moose — The largest of the deer species and the tallest mammals in North America, moose can stand 6 feet from ground to shoulder as fully grown adults. Adult male moose weigh between 1200 and 1800 pounds and can actually run up to 35 mph. Watch out for those antlers! They also can grow up to 6 feet long.\nAmerican Alligator — Mostly living in Florida and Louisiana, these fearsome creatures can grow up to 15 feet in length. They also can live as long as 50 years! Don’t get too close; they can move up to 15 mph on land and are not afraid to attack humans.\nCalifornia Condor — These are the largest bird in the United States and have been around for at least 40,000 years. With a 9-foot-long wingspan, the California condor soar in the sky over the wild open country of the Southwest. Condors scavenge the carcasses of deer and moose for their dinner.\nThe Flag of the United States of America\nThe flag of the United States of America is comprised of thirteen horizontal stripes, six in white and seven in red. The upper left corner has a blue square with fifty white stars representing the fifty US states. The colors themselves have rich meanings with red symbolizing valor and hardiness, blue representing justice and perseverance, and white for purity and high ideals.\nThere are a few nicknames for the flag including the Stars and Stripes, Old Glory, and the Star-Spangled Banner.\nAs to who designed the first flag, it is hard to say. Betsy Ross did not, in fact, sew the first American flag, as the rumor goes. There is also another young woman, Rebecca Young, who claimed to have sewn the first flag. She was, in fact, a flag seamstress during the American Revolution and her daughter, Mary Pickersgill, is known to have made the famous Star-Spangled Banner Flag.\nAnother person, a man named Fracis Hopkinson of New Jersey, was rumored to have designed the first U.S. flag, in addition to a flag for the U.S. Navy. He also was a signer of the Declaration of Independence.\nMore Articles Related to the United States\nRead about:\nall venomous snakes that can be found in the United States.\nsnakes that live in America’s Southern States\nthe most common rat species in the United States .\nfour animals invading the United States .\nthe most beautiful national parks in the United States .\nthe least crowded national parks in the summer .\nthe prettiest state parks in the United States .\nthe longest hiking trail in the United States .\nthe longest biking trails in the United States .\nthe oldest lake in the United States .\nthe best lakes in the United States for fishing .\nthe most leech-infested lakes in the United States .\nthe U.S. states that have no rattlesnakes .\nthe longest trail in the United States .\nthe most dangerous plants in the United States.\nthe largest zoo in the United States.\nthe most popular national parks in the United States .\nthe fastest rivers in the United States .\nthe cleanest lakes in the United States .\nthe largest dams in the United States .\nthe largest ports in the United States .\nthe most beautiful lakes in the United States .\nthe best lakes to camp in the United States .\nthe best camping spots in the United States .\nU.S. States Animal Lists\nClick any of the states below to see a detailed list of animals located in that state!\nAnimals in Alabama\nAnimals in Alaska\nAnimals in American Samoa\nAnimals in Arizona\nAnimals in Arkansas\nAnimals in California\nAnimals in Colorado\nAnimals in Connecticut\nAnimals in Delaware\nAnimals in District of Columbia\nAnimals in Florida\nAnimals in Georgia\nAnimals in Guam\nAnimals in Hawaii\nAnimals in Idaho\nAnimals in Illinois\nAnimals in Indiana\nAnimals in Iowa\nAnimals in Kansas\nAnimals in Kentucky\nAnimals in Louisiana\nAnimals in Maine\nAnimals in Maryland\nAnimals in Massachusetts\nAnimals in Michigan\nAnimals in Minnesota\nAnimals in Mississippi\nAnimals in Missouri\nAnimals in Montana\nAnimals in Nebraska\nAnimals in Nevada\nAnimals in New Hampshire\nAnimals in New Jersey\nAnimals in New Mexico\nAnimals in New York\nAnimals in North Carolina\nAnimals in North Dakota\nAnimals in Northern Mariana Islands\nAnimals in Ohio\nAnimals in Oklahoma\nAnimals in Oregon\nAnimals in Pennsylvania\nAnimals in Puerto Rico\nAnimals in Rhode Island\nAnimals in South Carolina\nAnimals in South Dakota\nAnimals in Tennessee\nAnimals in Texas\nAnimals in U.S. Virgin Islands\nAnimals in United States Minor Outlying Islands\nAnimals in Utah\nAnimals in Vermont\nAnimals in Virginia\nAnimals in Washington\nAnimals in West Virginia\nAnimals in Wisconsin\nAnimals in Wyoming\nAmerican Animals\nAcadian Flycatcher\nTheir nests are sloppily held together and have an abandoned appearance\nAdmiral Butterfly\nStunningly beautiful wings\nAgkistrodon Contortrix\nAgouti\nThe agouti is one of the only animals that can crack open Brazil nut pods!\nAiredoodle\nThis is a great pooch for rough-housing and one-to-one.\nAkita Shepherd\nThe Akita Shepherd descends from a lineage of working dogs.\nAlaskan Husky\nThe Alaskan Husky is one of the most common sled dogs in the world\nAlaskan Klee Kai\nAlaskan Klee Kais love to communicate with their families.

We currently track 557 animals in South America and are adding more every day!\nSouth America is home to some of the most unique, and exotic animals in the world. From the dangerous to the nearly extinct, we’ve created a list of the most interesting animals on the continent and some of the most exciting facts about them.\nThe Official National Animal of South America\nSouth America is a continent, and as such, it has no national animal. However, many of the countries within its borders have very prominent national animals that are worth mentioning. From exciting mammals to small omnivorous species, every country is incredibly proud of its individual mascot. For example, the national animal of Guatemala is the quetzal bird , while the national animal of Peru is the Vicuna, which is a type of llama .\nThe Vicuna, a type of llama, is the national animal of Peru.\n©ecuadorplanet/Shutterstock.com\nWhere to Find the Top Wild Animals in South America\nMost of the animals in South America can be found either in the Amazon Rainforest or along the Andes mountains. If you’re looking for wildlife, you can generally check nearby wooded areas and expansive grasslands. Most animals like to have shelter and tree cover, but many of the local herbivores prefer to live in open plains where they can see predators approaching.\nWhile Africa is the most popular continent to travel to for going on safaris, South America is also a destination that offers jungle safaris and other wildlife viewing options. Some of the best destinations to see diverse wildlife include the Galapagos Islands, Costa Rica, Brazil, Ecuador, and even Antarctica. Not only can you see interesting land mammals like sloths, jaguars, and llamas, but the oceans are teeming with manta rays, whales, and even rare pink dolphins.\nThe sloth is a sluggish tree-dweller native to Central and South America.\n©Kristel Segeren/Shutterstock.com\nHere is a list of some of the most interesting types of wildlife on the continent and a few facts about them:\nJaguar – The jaguar is the only panther that still exists in the Americas. You can find them in dense forests of all kinds across the continent; there have even been a few sightings within the borders of the United States .\nCapybara – Capybaras are extremely friendly creatures that socialize with all of the other animals in South America. You can usually find them exploring the rainforest, grazing in grasslands, or enjoying a nice soak in a local watering hole.\nTamarin – From the red-handed tamarin to the golden lion tamarin , South America’s tamarin population is famous, notable, and adorable. You can find this small omnivorous species in jungles and tropical forests, especially if there is fruit, sunshine, and relative safety.\nTapir – With their distinctive noses and friendly attitudes, tapirs are one of South America’s most iconic inhabitants. You can find tapirs roaming the continent’s many beautiful grasslands.\nLlama – Llamas have soft, fluffy fur and gregarious personalities. You can usually find llamas in mountainous areas, but they are also known to descend to slightly lower elevations to explore the grassy plains.\nGuinea Pig – The guinea pig is typically seen as a house pet, but you can also find herds of guinea pigs living happily in the Andes mountains and the surrounding areas.\nSloth – Sloths can be found in the tallest and largest trees across the continent. Many sloths will never leave the tree in which they were born; tree-switching is rare and takes significant effort.\nThe Most Dangerous Animals in South America Today\nSouth America’s jungles are known for being full of incredibly dangerous animals. Even small omnivorous creatures can turn on you with poisonous teeth and claws. In areas that humans inhabit, South American animals that seem to pose a large threat to are snakes. There are an estimated 70,000 cases of snake bites reported annually, with venomous pit vipers being responsible for 70-90% of them. The chief offenders are snakes like the fer-de-lance and the South American rattlesnake .\nThere’s a 7-9% mortality rate for humans bit by a Fer-de-lance snake who do not receive anti-venom.\n©Jim Cumming/Shutterstock.com\nBut snakes are not the only animals to beware of in South America. Whether you’re traveling down an undeveloped road or simply out for nature observation, keep an eye out for the following list of rare and exotic wildlife:\nGreen Anaconda – Although they are non-venomous, green anacondas are incredibly large and powerful constrictors that are capable of killing humans even when they are quite young. Give these snakes a wide berth, and they should have no reason to attack you.\nPoison Dart Frog – Poison dart frogs are so toxic that they aren’t safe to touch with bare hands. Resist the temptation to reach out and pet one of these adorable and brightly-colored amphibians.\nBullet Ant – Getting bitten by a bullet ant won’t kill you, but the pain is excruciating and can last up to 24 hours.\nBlack Caiman – Caiman lizards are large and effective predators that dwell deep in the Amazon Jungle. In particular, Black Caimans are responsible for most direct attacks on humans.\nKissing Bug – Also known as vampire bugs, kissing bugs are an incredibly poisonous species that like to land on human faces and bite them near the lip. Kissing bugs might not kill you immediately, but their unique venom causes around 30% of their victims to develop chronic health problems that can result in sudden heart failure later down the line.\nEndangered Animals in South America\nSouth America is full of rare, unique, and exotic species that you can’t find anywhere else in the world. Unfortunately, due to a combination of climate change and human interference, more than 30% of species on the content are endangered or nearly extinct.\nAs of 2022, 361 animal species were registered as endangered on the IUCN Red List. A whopping 326 of those species inhabit Brazil. Two main reasons are illegal hunting and forest fires. Also, the largest savannah area in South America, referred to as the “Cerrado,” stretches across Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay, and is inhabited by  837 species of birds, 120 reptiles, 150 amphibians, 1,200 fish, 90,000 insects, and 199 mammals. Because the Cerrado is vanishing due to cattle ranching and agricultural expansion, multiple species have come under threat of extinction like the maned wolf, jaguar, giant anteater, and gain armadillo.\nThe maned wolf, whose habitat is the Cerrado, is under threat of extinction due to habitat loss.\n©JWKS Photomancy/Shutterstock.com\nHere are just a few facts about some of South America’s struggling animals:\nOrinoco Crocodile – Orinoco crocodiles are some of the largest predators on the continent. However, because they were so heavily hunted for their leather in the 1900s, the population of this species is below 500.\nLemur Leaf Frog – Lemur leaf frogs are adorable and friendly rainforest inhabitants. Unfortunately, a disease outbreak in the 2010s reduced their numbers by over 80%, putting this species at serious risk.\nGiant Otter – Giant otters live in rivers of the Amazon Jungle, but their population numbers have dropped steadily over the last few decades. Today, the species is preserved in Peru’s many national parks.\nBlack Squirrel Monkey – Due to habitat loss, many squirrel monkeys have been forced to dine on local crops and end up falling victim to pesticides. This problem has made the species endangered far more quickly than local residents expected.\nPink Amazon Dolphin – Also known as the Amazon river dolphin, these distinctly pink-colored porpoises are rare but important to the local ecosystem. Population numbers are hard to estimate but have been noted to be dwindling.\nJaguar – Jaguars are endangered for a variety of reasons, including loss of habitat and deliberate poaching. These animals were naturally low in numbers and are nearly extinct in the modern day.\nThe 5 Rarest South American Animals\nThe Golden Lion Tamarin is an endangered New World monkey native to Brazil.\n©Mistvan / Creative Commons\nIf you were to take a trip to South America, we’ve compiled a list of animals that would be worth your efforts to try and catch a glimpse of in the wild. However, it’d be a challenging task, as these animals are rare, either because they are endangered or just plain elusive.\nGalapagos Tortoise : This endangered species once numbered around 250,000 when Charles Darwin famously visited the islands. But by the 1970s their numbers had dwindled to 3000 because of their meat and oils and fats. Invasive species like rats also struck a blow to their populations. You have a good chance of seeing one if you travel to the Galapagos Islands.\nGolden Lion Tamarin : This endangered New World monkey, also called the golden marmoset, is native to the Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil. Spotting one of these adorable creatures in the wild would be a rare treat.\nAmazon River Dolphin : One of the rarest and most beautiful sea creatures found in South America is this pink-colored river dolphin, which inhabits the Orinoco and Amazon basins, as well as the upper Madeira River in Bolivia.\nMargay : It’s a small, solitary wild cat that lives a nocturnal lifestyle in evergreen and deciduous forests of Central and South America. They were illegally hunted till the 1990s, which greatly decreased their numbers. This animal would be rare to see in the wild, but worth it.\nManed Wolf : While neither a fox nor a wolf, the maned wolf has features of both animals. It’s a wild dog species that inhabits open and semi-open areas such as the Cerrado.\nThe 5 Largest South American Animals\nWhile no land animal compares in size to the elephant, there are some South American animals that make the list for their height, length, and bulk. Here’s a look at the five largest South American animals:\nJaguar : With a length of up to 6 ft and a max weight of 348 lbs, the Jaguar is the largest wild cat in the Americas and the third largest cat in the world. It sports a beautiful yellow coat covered in rosettes that helps it hide in jungle vegetation, while some jaguars are pure black in color.\nCaiman : While this reptile is not as big as the standard alligator or crocodile, it does compete for the top prize of the largest animal in South America with a length of 16-20 feet and a weight of 13-88 pounds. Caimans inhabit the rivers, lakes, swamps, marshes, and mangroves of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay.\nAndean Condor : This bird is not only the largest in South America but the biggest flying bird and bird of prey in the world! Its wingspan is a maximum of 10’10” wide and its max weight is 33 lbs. It’s the national bird of Bolivia, and also inhabits Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Columbia.\nTapir : Besides taking the top prize as the largest land mammal in South America, the tapir is also one of the oldest living mammals, its origins dating back to the Eocene Epoch, from 56 to 33.9 million years ago. Its height can reach to nearly 4 feet and its weight is up to 700 pounds. This unique animal looks like a cross between a pig, rhino, and horse, and sports a long proboscis.\nCapybara : The capybara is the largest rodent species on earth, having a max weight of 154 lbs and a max height of 2 ft. Related to guinea pigs, capybaras are social animals that live in groups of up to 100 in areas like swamps, rivers, ponds, and lakes. They are not semi-aquatic but are excellent swimmers.\nHonorable mention : Hippopotamus\nThe hippo is not native to South America, but rather to Africa. But Pablo Escobar had a set of four imported to his compound in Colombia during his reign, and now there are up to 120 hippos in that country, some of which have wandered up to 230 miles from his compound, where most still reside on or near. Scientists have warned that by 2034, there could be as many as 1,400 hippos, which could pose a threat to manatees and other fish species. Hippos can grow up to 16 feet long, weigh up to 4.5 tons, and sport teeth measuring 20 inches long.\nSouth American Countries Animals Lists\nClick any of the countries below to see a detailed list of animals located in that country!\nAnimals in Argentina\nAnimals in Bolivia\nAnimals in Brazil\nAnimals in Chile\nAnimals in Colombia\nAnimals in Ecuador\nAnimals in Falkland Islands\nAnimals in French Guiana\nAnimals in Guyana\nAnimals in Paraguay\nAnimals in Peru\nAnimals in Suriname\nAnimals in Uruguay\nAnimals in Venezuela\nSouth American Animals\nAbyssinian Guinea Pig\nThey are one of the oldest breeds of guinea pig\nAcadian Flycatcher\nTheir nests are sloppily held together and have an abandoned appearance\nAfricanized bee (killer bee)\nWill chase intruders up to a quarter mile from their hives\nAgouti\nThe agouti is one of the only animals that can crack open Brazil nut pods!\nAlbatross\nThe largest wingspan of any bird in the world!\nAlpaca\nThey can spit up to 10 feet.\nAmargasaurus\nAmazon Parrot\nThese parrots can be trained to be \"talking birds\" that mimic human speech\nAmazon Tree Boa\nAmazon tree boas come in a rainbow of colors.\nAmazonian Royal Flycatcher\nThey use their bright royal-looking crests during mating season\nAnaconda\nThey are the heaviest snake in the world\nAngora Goat\nEach adult Angora goat produces about 12 inches of mohair annually while kids have about 8 inches.\nAnhinga\nTheir name means snake bird\nAnt\nFirst evolved 100 million years ago!\nAnteater\nHas the longest tongue of any animal in relation to its body size!\nArapaima\nOne of the largest freshwater fish\nArctotherium\nThe first fossil from the genus Arctotherium was discovered back in 1852.\nArgentavis Magnificens\nThe Argentavis Magnificens was the heaviest flight bird to ever exist\nArgentine Black and White Tegu\ngiant lizard kept as pets\nArgentinosaurus\nThe Argentinosaurus weighed as much as 10 elephants!\nArmadillo\nCan curl into a hard, protective ball!\nArmored Catfish\nArmyworm\nThey are so named because they \"march\" in armies of worms from one crop to another in search of food\nAruba Rattlesnake\nThis rattlesnake only lives on the island of Aruba.\nAsian Lady Beetle\nAsian lady beetles infest indoor spaces, but they do not reproduce indoors.\nAvocet\nHas a curved, upturned beak!\nBagworm Moth\nThere are approximately 1350 species in the bagworm moth family (Psychidae), which forms part of the order Lepidoptera.\nBanjo Catfish\nThe banjo catfish is extremely shy and known for hiding from onlookers.\nBarb\nThere are over 1768 known species!\nBarinasuchus\nLargest terrestrial predator of the Cenozoic era\nBark Beetle\nNot all bark beetles feed on a tree's bark.

Their class is Aves and their clade is Psittacopassarae. The scientific name for parrot is Psittaciformes. The family is broken down into three superfamiles. True parrots are called Psittacoidea. Cockatoos are Cacatuoidea. New Zealand parrots are called Strigopoidea. There are 398 species of parrot in the world!\nThe scientific name for parrot is Psittaciformes\n©Quatro212/Shutterstock.com\nHealth and Entertainment for your Parrot\nSee all of our expert product reviews .\nEvolution\nMolecular data has suggested that the cockatoos and other psittaciforms split from each other prior to the K/T boundary at 65 million years ago (MYA). Further parrot lineages started to form around 60-65 MYA when Australia and New Guinea were first separated from East Antarctica. It is estimated that the major parrot families were established by 30 MYA, when Australia, Antarctica, and South America had completely separated.\nAccording to fossil data calibrated at 50 MYA, this split happened 45.04 MYA, shortly before Australia’s separation from Antarctica. Parrots in Neotropical regions began to evolve 33 MYA, when South America parted from West Antarctica.\nEvidence suggests that Australia is the origin of parrots due to the high number of endemic genera, some of which are close to the base of the psittaciform tree. Additionally, the split of New Zealand taxa is an indication that their origin was in Gondwana during the Cretaceous. The cockatoos form a monophyletic group (one common ancestor) while many parrots are polyphyletic (more than one common ancestor). There is no clear relationship between some parrot species and other modern birds. This study suggests that Aves evolved during the Cretaceous and parrots are an ancient lineage with no close evolutionary relatives. Many scientists are working to unravel this mystery.\nParrots originated from Australia many millions of years ago.\n©Bryoni Castelijn/Shutterstock.com\nCommon Types of Parrots\nGrey Parrot – The grey parrot is a medium sized bird native to Africa . They are predominantly grey with black bills and red tail feathers.\nMacaw – Macaws range in size from small (like the Hahn’s Macaw, measuring around 12 inches long) to large (like theHyacinth macaw, measuring around 40 inches long). Macaws are native to Mexico, Central America, and South America. These birds have long tails and large beaks.\nCockatiel – Cockatiels are small birds with pointed tails that are endemic to Australia. Pet cockatiels have been bred to exhibit a variety of colors. Wild cockatiels are generally grey with white flashes on either wing and orange spots on the sides of their face.\nBudgerigar – Also known as the parakeet, this bird is small and long-tailed bird. These birds are bright green with yellow heads and black barring on the wings. Budgerigars are local to Australia.\nAmazon Parrot – Amazon parrots are medium sized, short-tailed parrots native to South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. These birds are primarily green with bright accenting colors, differing by the species.\nEclectus Parrot are found in Western Papuan Islands, New Guinea.\n©iStock.com/Ondrej Prosicky\nAppearance and Behavior\nParrots vary in their bright colored feathers and each species varies in its pigmentation. Most people think of a these birds as bright green, accented by beautiful, strong, curved bills. Standing upright, parrots perch and even walk around upright with their clawed feet.\nNot all of these species are one color, such as the macaw, which range from black, red, or yellow. Macaws, like the majority of parrots, are not sexually dimorphic, meaning there is no visual difference between males and females.\nIn temperament, these birds tend to be affectionate, earning them status as well-loved pets for centuries. Their high energy levels may be more than a novice pet owner can handle, but these creatures express empathy at a unique level. However, the humans that they reside with play a huge role in a bird’s mood and behavior.\nDo be cautious – some species are incredibly dangerous and aggressive if provoked. The Senegal parrot , for example, is rather small, but they will bite down hard with their sharp beak if they feel threatened, causing substantial pain and possible injury.\nMost often parrots will only attack if in danger, a natural “fight or flight” response to protect themselves from harm. In captivity, whether in a zoo or home, parrots may throw food around and tear up their surroundings if agitated or fearful. Parrots are chatty throughout the day and night, filling their homes with an array of loud vocalizations and potential imitations.\nThis parrot’s chirp can reach up to 115 decibels.\n©iStock.com/redchanka\nPersonality\nParrots are incredibly smart and witty. If kept as a pet, they form a tight bond and are mostly friendly and social. They enjoy being close to the social activity in the home, allowing them to build trust and form lasting relationships.\nHighly energetic, parrots have surprisingly short attention spans. However, they make plenty of time to provide a dramatic display of their emotions, thanks to the empathetic nature of the bird. As these birds spend more time with its human owner, it may start to imitate common phrases and sounds that it hears.\nThe yellow-billed parrot is one of the many feathered residents of Jamaica.\n©Ondrej Prosicky/Shutterstock.com\nHabitat\nParrots often thrive in tropical areas, due to the warm and humid climate. However, they don’t necessarily require this habitat to survive, which is why so many of the birds reside in warm climates worldwide. Apart from pet stores, there species naturally span across Australia , South America , and Central America .\nMost wild parrots will build a place to rest in broad-leafed deciduous trees and bright tropical plants while domesticated ones are able to adapt to their present home environments.\nGrey-yellow female budgie cockatiel parrot thrives in tropical areas.\n©iStock.com/Vronja_Photon\nDiet\nOmnivorous in nature, these birds have a varied diet. As a pet, diet should mimic that of a wild parrot’s, including raw or steamed vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, and whole grains (like rice, oats, quinoa, barley, or buckwheat). If available, an organic diet best supports a parrot, preventing them from ingesting dangerous chemicals that may cause health problems.\nMost of the bird’s typical diet consists of fruits, nuts, seeds, flowers, and buds. Some species thrive (almost) exclusively on nectar. While they will consume both raw and cooked vegetables, the only animals that have to worry about their predatory nature are insects. If a parrot fails to find insects to eat, they will occasionally hunt snails, mice, or snakes instead.\nParrots eat insects, seeds, nuts and fruits.\n©A-Z-Animals.com\nPredators and Threats\nLike all living animals, parrots are an important contributor to the natural food chain. They are both prey and predator in the wild, falling victim to raptorial birds that are larger than them.\nHowever, the main threat to these birds is humans . Human activities – like deforestation, encroachment, industrialization, etc. – destroy their natural habitat. Along with the loss of habitat, human activities also weaken and damage the forests where parrots abide, preventing these birds and other animals from maintaining a consistent source of food, interrupting reproductive and growth cycles as well.\nThe hyacinth macaw is the largest flying parrot.\n©iStock.com/Uwe-Bergwitz\nReproduction and Lifespan\nMost species are monogamous, meaning they remain with the same partner for their entire lives. When these birds choose a breeding partner for themselves, they stay together throughout the non-breeding seasons as well.\nParrots prefer to mate with the changing seasons of their environment, mainly the warmer time of the year. Most often, the reproductive process starts during the spring months, due to the higher temperatures and the ample availability of food sources for offspring. During these months, parrots begin naturally releasing sex hormones, attracting opposite sexes for mating.\nLike many other birds, parrots lay eggs. At one time, they usually lay about two to eight eggs. An incubation of about 18 to 30 days occurs before hatching. Parrot offspring are simply called “chicks” like many other avian species.\nSmall parrots tend to live for about 15 to 20 years, while larger species can live up to 80 years. A handful of these specie have broken records for living for 100 years! When considering an avian companion, it is crucial to understand that it is, potentially, a lifetime commitment.\nParrots are monogamous, meaning they remain with the same partner for their entire lives. This can be up to 100 years!\n©Shark_749/Shutterstock.com\nPopulation\nThe exact number of parrots around the world is currently not well known. However, there are more than 350 species of parrots that exist in different parts of the world including a macaw, grey parrot, and monk parakeet .\nSince parrots as a group were declared “not extinct” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, no conservation efforts have been made on a broader scale. However, as recently as the last decade, the trading and habitat destruction of parrots led nearly 50% of these species to become endangered. Half of these species are now considered “critically endangered.” Some species – like the citron-crested cockatoo – are sold so frequently on the black market that local governments have imposed restrictions.\nWhile some laws protect against trading and hunting, thanks to The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, parrots are largely still kept in captivity as pets or zoo attractions.Some of the zoos in the United States popular for their parrot exhibits include the San Diego Zoo , the Houston Zoo , and the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden .\nThe African Grey Parrot can learn around 1,000 words. There are 350 types of parrtos in the world.\n©iStock.com/Adrian Black\nConservation\nSadly, nearly a third of all parrot species are facing the danger of extinction. Human activity is typically the cause of this serious issue, with habitat loss and fragmentation being the largest problem. Illegal capture and poaching of nests also play a significant role. Other threats include climate change, disease, and environmental pollution. All of these factors have a negative effect on wild parrot populations.\nParrots are critically endangered. Many parrot species have less than 50 living members on earth.\n©iStock.com/GlobalP\nOwner Tips\nBefore owning a bird, especially intelligent and highly attentive parrots, it is crucial to understand that these birds live for decades and require constant stimulation. All over the world, wild birds are illegally taken from their natural habitats and sold as pets. Tragically, almost 80% of these captured birds die before reaching their destination, killed by disease, starvation, trauma, or injury. Perpetrators capture these birds by violent means of cutting down trees or slicing through nests, resulting in destroyed habitats, affecting other bird and animal populations. While protectionshave been enacted to prevent such brutality, these rules are difficult to enforce and easy to get around. While certain bird species are able to reproduce in captivity, many of them are still being plucked from the wild.\nUnfortunately, many pet owners do not research their companions before owning a bird and grow tired or annoyed by the animals. Some birds escape while others are released, resulting in feral populations. These non-native birds may introduce disease or invasive species to their new surroundings, detrimental to native bird and animal populations. If you are unable to further care for your domesticated bird, make sure to take it to a humane organization for it to be rehomed.\nBefore owning a bird, especially intelligent and highly attentive parrots, it is crucial to understand that these birds live for decades and require constant stimulation.\n©TumCruise/Shutterstock.com\nIntelligence and Learning\nSome grey parrots have known a highly sensitive ability to associate words with meanings and be able to form simple sentences. These characteristics are common among crows, ravens, and parrots. Parrots are considered to be the most intelligent birds, their brain-to-body size ratio is comparable to that of great apes and other higher primates. Instead of using the cerebral cortex like mammals do, birds use the mediorostral HVC for cognition.\nNot only have parrots shown how smart they are through scientific testing, but the use of their language ability is astounding. Additionally, some parrots have even been known to use tools and solve puzzles.\nLearning early in life for these animals is very important and much of that learning comes from socially interactive environments. Social interactions are sometimes practiced with siblings or several other species. Parrots are known to form strong bonds with their playmates and owners.\nNot only have parrots shown how smart they are through scientific testing, but the use of their language ability is astounding. Additionally, some parrots have even been known to use tools and solve puzzles.\n©iStock.com/Lilly Nonamaker\nView all 187 animals that start with P\nAbout the Author\nAustin S.\nGrowing up in rural New England on a small scale farm gave me a lifelong passion for animals.

The first rodents evolved during the Late Paleocene or Early Eocene period, around 55 to 60 million years ago. The earliest known rodent fossils have been found in North America, but they quickly spread to other parts of the world.\nHealth and Entertainment for your Rat\nSee all of our expert product reviews .\nThe ancestors of modern rats were likely small, burrowing animals that lived in grasslands and forests. Over time, they evolved to adapt to a wide range of environments, from deserts to wetlands.\nRats are believed to have first evolved in Asia, and then spread to other parts of the world. The black rat, also known as the ship rat, is thought to have originated in tropical Asia and spread to Europe and Africa via trade routes. The brown rat, also known as the Norway rat, is believed to have originated in northern China and spread to Europe and North America.\nScientific Name\nThe scientific name for a black rat is Rattus rattus.\n©iStock.com/Irina Ilina\nThe scientific name for a black rat is Rattus rattus. Rattus is the medieval Latin name for a rat. The black rat is also called a house rat.\nThis animal belongs to the Muridae family and the classification Mammalia.\nOther species include:\nRice-field rat\nHoffmann’s Sulawesi rat\nAustralian swamp rat\nBrown rat\nOsgood’s Vietnamese rat\nNortheaster Xanthurus rat\nBlack rat\nBushy-tailed woodrat\nBush rat\nBulldog rat\nPolynesian rat\nGreater bandicoot rat\nGiant kangaroo rat\nPalm rat\nDesert kangaroo rat\nAllegheny woodrat\nLesser bandicoot rat\nOpossum rat\nLong-haired rat\nEastern woodrat\nOrd’s kangaroo rat\nDusky-footed woodrat\nMerriam’s kangaroo rat\nSan Quintin kangaroo rat\nMaclear’s rat\nTexas kangaroo rat\nCalifornia kangaroo rat\nDesert woodrat\nSlender rat\nHimalayan field rat\nGlacier rat\nTanezumi rat\nWhite-throated woodrat\nStephens’s kangaroo rat\nMalayan field rat\nNonsense rat\nKerala rat\nPhilippine forest rat\nBanner-tailed kangaroo rat\nFresno kangaroo rat\nPanamint kangaroo rat\nMexican woodrat\nBig-eared woodrat\nChisel-toothed kangaroo rat\nDusky rat\nMindoro black rat\nJapen rat\nPale field rat\nNillu rat\nSummit rat\nLesser ricefield rat\nSouthern Plains woodrat\nAppearance & Behavior\nThese animals can have black, brown, gray, or white fur. They have two big ears, dark eyes, and long whiskers. They have a mouthful of sharp teeth including 4 incisors. Their teeth continue to grow throughout its life. So, they have to chew on food and other items to wear down the edges.\nOne of their most notable features is a long, hairless tail. Generally, the animal’s tail is as long or longer than its body. The length of the tail is around 7 inches.\nThe animal uses its tail for more than one purpose. For one, it helps it to regulate its temperature. Its tail is hairless so it’s able to release heat to keep a rat’s body cool. Alternatively, when the animal is cold, it can curl its tail around itself to stay warm.\nSecondly, a rat’s tail helps it to maintain its balance. They climb up walls and trees and walk along narrow ledges. Their tail helps them to keep their weight balanced so they don’t fall. It is incredible to know that rats also possess excellent swimming abilities.\nThese rodents weigh from 3 to 10 ounces and are 6 to 8 inches long. A rat weighing 10 ounces is a little heavier than a can of soup in your kitchen cabinet. In addition, a rat that’s 8 inches long is half as tall as a bowling pin.\nThe largest rat in the world is the Northern Luzon Giant cloud rat. Its scientific name is Phloeomys pallidum. This rodent grows to 2 and a half feet long and weighs close to 6 pounds. Now that’s a big rat !\nThese animals can fit into very small places. Some scientists believe that if the animal can fit its head into a hole, it can get the rest of its body through. This is one of its defenses against predators. They also have very sharp teeth that they use to defend themselves against attack.\nIn addition, their black, brown, or gray fur helps them to blend in with the dark underground environment.\nThese rodents are social creatures with each other. In fact, if the animal is left alone for any span of time it can become listless and depressed. Wild rats are shy and try to avoid being seen by humans or other animals. Pet rats can be very friendly and playful critters if raised around people.\nA group of rats is called mischief and can contain a dozen or more members.\nRat vs Mouse: What is the Difference?\nRats and mice both fall under the mammal classification. But there are several differences between these two rodents.\n©Marina_Saw_it/Shutterstock.com\nRats and mice both fall under the mammal classification. But there are several differences between these two rodents.\nOne of the main differences between them is size. Mice are smaller than rats. A mouse weighs about one ounce to one and a half ounces.\nAnother difference is a mouse has hair on its tail while a rat’s tail is hairless.\nThe lifespan of a house mouse is less than a year whereas a rat can live up to 3 years.\nHabitat\nThese rodents live throughout the world. They live in India, Asia, North America, South America, Europe, and Australia. Humans have even introduced some rats to the continent of Antarctica. These animals live in warm to temperate climates. Think of it this way. Wherever humans live there are sure to be some rats nearby.\nThese animals are adaptable to a variety of habitats. Some live in trees while others live in nests , attics, and basements of homes. They live in drain pipes, in city sewers, and near rivers. Many of them live underground most of the time and come out of their hiding place to look for food.\nA rat uses its whiskers to safely navigate its way through dark tunnels and narrow spaces. Their whiskers are doubly important because these rodents are active during the night.\nThese rodents need to live in warm areas. So, when the cold weather arrives , they leave fields and wooded areas moving into homes, buildings, sheds, and other structures.\nDiet\nRats eat insects, fruits, grains, and vegetables.\n©A-Z-Animals.com\nWhat do these rodents eat? They are omnivores so they eat both plants and animals. They eat fruit, nuts, seeds, insects, small animals, and eggs. The specific diet of these animals depends a lot on the food available in their habitat.\nA rodent that lives in the woods may eat mostly seeds, nuts, and fruits. Alternatively, a rat that lives in a city sewer is likely to eat meat, bread, and other items it finds in trash cans or on the street. A rodent that lives on the shore near a river is likely to eat bird eggs, baby turtles , fish , and other small animals.\nThe rodents that eat from garbage cans are at risk of ingesting items that make them sick. Expired or rotting food are two examples of items that would make a rat sick. However, they have an excellent sense of smell so it’s good at avoiding spoiled food. But don’t put it past them to eat too many potato chips!\nPredators and Threats\nHawks, owls, and falcons are all predators of these animals. Domestic dogs and cats can also be threats to these rodents.\n©Gallinago_media/Shutterstock.com\nHawks, owls , and falcons are all predators of these animals. Domestic dogs and cats can also be threats to these rodents.\nThe conservation status of the black rat is the Least Concern .\nBlack rats that build nests in the attics or basements of homes are at risk of being killed by an exterminator. But despite being thought of as a pest, the overall population of these animals remains stable.\nAs a note, the Northeaster Xanthurus species has a conservation status of Near Threatened with a decreasing population. These rodents live in Indonesia and are threatened by loss of habitat due to logging activity and farming.\nThese animals have a reputation for spreading disease to humans and other animals. It’s true that they can spread disease if they bite a human or another animal. Also, the disease can be spread when a human touches a dead rat or comes in contact with their feces. Plus, fleas and ticks on these animals can contract a disease from them and spread it to animals and humans.\nSome of the diseases these animals carry include:\nSalmonellosis: Contracted by ingesting the rodents’ feces\nTularemia: Contracted through fleas or ticks that have been on a contaminated animal\nPlague: Contracted through a bite from a flea that has been on an infected animal\nAs a note, the plague and this rodent are connected in history. The Bubonic plague spread in the Middle Ages killing millions of people in Europe. Fortunately, things have changed since then. This disease can be treated with modern antibiotics.\nReproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThe breeding season of the black rat takes place in summer and fall.\n©iStock.com/Kseniia Glazkova\nGenerally, the breeding season of the black rat takes place in summer and fall. But these animals have been known to breed at any time throughout the year. Each pack, or mischief, has a dominant male that mates with several females. These rodents have multiple partners. The dominant male fiercely defends his pack during the breeding season.\nA female makes a nest out of whatever material she can find. Leaves, shredded paper, insulation, cardboard, and grass are just some of the materials. She can make her nest almost anywhere. One animal may build a nest in a burrow in the woods while another chooses one corner of an attic.\nA female can have as many as 5 litters of babies per year. Her gestation period runs from 21 to 29 days. She can have 8 to 12 babies in one litter.\nThe babies, or pups, are born without any hair and their eyes closed. They have tiny pink bodies that weigh less than an ounce. These animals have the mammal classification, so females nurse their young. The male doesn’t provide any care for the pups.\nA pup’s eyes open when they are 15 days old. They begin to eat solid food and grow their fur coat at 3 weeks old. Pups are independent by the time they are 4 weeks old.\nAs with most rodents, these animals are vulnerable to respiratory infection and disease. One respiratory ailment of them is caused by bacteria called mycoplasma.\nAlso, rodents that don’t chew enough food and other materials can suffer from overgrown teeth. Having teeth that are overgrown can interfere with a rat’s ability to get enough nourishment.\nThey can also develop tumors in their body.\nThese rodents are sexually mature at 3 to 5 months old. They have a lifespan of 2 to 3 years.\nPopulation\nAccording to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species , the black rat has a widespread and abundant population . Its numbers are holding steady.\nThe black rat lives throughout the southeastern United States and down into Mexico. This animal is also found in Massachusetts up into British Columbia.\nRats in the Zoo\nDomestic rats are on display at the Seneca Zoo\nVisit the rat exhibit at the Smithsonian National Zoo\nView all 110 animals that start with R\nAbout the Author\nRebecca\nMy name is Rebecca and I've been a Professional Freelancer for almost a decade.

Instead, they swallow it whole.\n©Steve Byland/Shutterstock.com\nHere are a few interesting facts about these reptiles:\nHealth and Entertainment for your Snake\nSee all of our expert product reviews .\nOut of over 4,000 different species, only 600 are venomous. Snakes like the gopher snake and kingsnakes are nonvenomous . Only 200 of these snakes have enough potency to harm a human.\nThough they are a reptile , like a lizard, they have no eyelids or ear holes.\nSnakes do not chew their food , despite the presence of teeth. Instead, they swallow it whole.\nThese reptiles can be found on every continent but Antarctica .\nThe snake to have lived the longest is located in Missouri and she is 62 years old.\nScientific Name\nSnakes go by the scientific name Serpentes and belong to the kingdom Animalia and Phylum Chordata .\n©Nathan A Shepard/Shutterstock.com\nThese reptiles go by the scientific name\nSerpentes and belong to the kingdom Animalia and Phylum Chordata . Their class is called Reptilia and the order is called Squamata . The clade is called Ophidia .\nSerpentes , which is often shortened to the serpent in mythical stories, come from the Latin word “serpō,” which means “creep” or “crawl.”\nEvolution and Origins\nSnakes are a group of reptiles that evolved from lizards around 150 million years ago during the Late Jurassic period. They have evolved to have long, slender bodies and no limbs, allowing them to move efficiently through various habitats such as grasslands, deserts, and forests.\nSnakes are thought to have evolved from terrestrial lizards, with their ancestors likely having four legs. Over time, snakes lost their limbs through a process of evolution known as reduction. This happens when certain body parts are no longer needed and become smaller until they eventually disappear.\nToday, there are around 3,000 species of snakes found on every continent except Antarctica.\nAppearance\nSome snakes are as short as 4.1 inches (like the Barbados thread snake), though the longest snake in the world (which is the reticulated python) is over 20 feet long.\n©Patrick K. Campbell/Shutterstock.com\nSnakes are reptiles , but they noticeably have no legs . However, not every legless reptile is known as a snake.\nSeemingly, the only components of a snake are its head and its tail, which take up the entire length of its body. Some snakes are as short as 4.1 inches (like the Barbados thread snake), though the longest snake in the world (which is the reticulated python) is over 20 feet long.\nThe teeth of these reptiles will vary by species as well. Many species have several needle-sharp teeth, but venomous species have fangs. Venomous snakes typically store the venom in glands the in the head behind their eyes. Only about 600 snake species are venomous. A snake , sometimes referred to as a serpent, has no earholes, but its ears are internal.\nThese reptiles are covered in scales, though they have skin like humans underneath them. Some snakes have keeled scales with a ridge down the center of each scale, and others have smooth scales. The markings are determined by the species, but there is hardly a color that you won’t see.\nThe color is sometimes a sign of how dangerous the snake is, but the pattern will help differentiate the threats from harmless animals. Snakes come in every color of the rainbow, including red, green, yellow, blue, and black.\nRattlesnakes have a large rattle at the end of their tail, which emits a loud noise to let animals and humans keep away. It is also important to note that there are some animals that look like snakes , but aren’t.\nThe body of the animal is also indicative of the way that the snake hunts. Animals with long and thin bodies are usually more active hunters, often chasing down their prey; while short yet thick snakes typically sit and wait for their prey.\nRead here to learn more about the anatomy of snakes .

Read here to find out about them.\nBehavior\nWhen it comes to hunting, snakes have an incredible sense of smell that they rely on. As they flick out their tongue, they seek out the chemicals in the air.\n©reptiles4all/Shutterstock.com\nWhen it comes to hunting, snakes have an incredible sense of smell that they rely on. As they flick out their tongue, they seek out the chemicals in the air. Other snakes will use their ability to detect body heat. Constriction and venom tend to be the main ways that the prey is overpowered.\nThese reptiles seek out the right environment to keep their body warm since their cold-blooded body is unable to regulate their temperature internally . Snakes move back and forth between warm and cool areas, depending on their needs.\nSnakes shed their skin as they grow; many shed 2-4 times per year. The shedding process can be rather uncomfortable, but it is a healthy process that reptiles undergo.\nThough some species produce venom, the majority do not. Only 600 species have any kind of venom , and only a third of those venomous snakes have the capacity to wound humans at all, and even fewer can fatally kill them. Learn about the toughest animals in the world here .\nThough humans are not a natural part of the reptile’s diet, it will bite if it feels threatened. In certain species, this bite can be fatal. There are scary and dangerous species in the world , the most lethal being the saw-scaled viper, killing more humans than any other species.\nRead about the most dangerous animals on earth to humans here.\nCommon Types of Snakes\nLike all pythons, the African Rock Python is non-venomous. It kills by constriction, ambushing, and coiling around its prey.\n©zaferkizilkaya/Shutterstock.com\nThe following list includes some common types of snakes found around the world:\nPythons – Pythons are a family of snakes consisting of 42 total recognized species. These reptiles can be found mostly in Asia, Australia, and Africa ; however, the Burmese python was introduced in the Florida Everglades and is currently considered an invasive species . Most species in this family are “ambush predators” meaning they remain motionless and strike as prey passes.\nElapids – Most elapids are commonly referred to as “cobras;” however, not all elapids are cobras. These snakes are characterized by erect, venomous fangs at the front of their mouths, and species can be terrestrial or aquatic. Elapids are endemic to tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world.\nRattlesnakes – Rattlesnakes are found on the American continent and are characterized by the rattle at the end of their tails which they use to scare off predators. Although rattlesnakes rarely attack humans unless provoked, rattlesnake bites are the leading cause of snakebite injuries in North America. They are an example of pit vipers of the Viperidae family of snakes.\nGarters – Garter snakes are generally harmless in North and Central America. These snakes were long believed to be non-venomous, but recent studies have determined that they produce a neurotoxic venom that is too mild to injure or kill a human.\nAdditional types of snakes include:\nCobras\nKing cobra\nVipers\nAnaconda\nGreen anaconda\nBall python\nGrass snake\nTitanoboa\nKingsnakes\nCorn snake\nBoa constrictor\nColubrid Snakes\nInland taipan\nAcrochordus arafurae\nMambas\nBlack mamba\nBoas\nCoral reef snakes\nTaipan\nEastern brown snake\nRed-bellied black snake\nBoomslang\nElapid snakes\nEmerald tree boa\nQueen snake\nBrahminy blind snake\nXenopeltis unicolor\nElephant trunk snake\nBlind snakes\nAcrochordus granulatus\nMalpolon monspessulanus\nSunbeam snakes\nMole snake\nGigantophis garstini\nCylindrophis ruffus\nTyphlopidae\nLamprophis\nNajash rionegrina\nNinia\nAmblyodipsas\nAnilius\nFalse cobra\nSharp-tailed snakes\nAlethinophidia\nMole Vipers\nPsammophis\nUropeltidae\nHabitat\nSnakes are quite versatile, and many types work in the climates of the world.\n©PaniYani/Shutterstock.com\nSnakes are quite versatile, and many types work in the climates of the world. Though the only continent without snakes is Antarctica , there are a few countries that aren’t home to any native snakes, including Ireland , New Zealand , and Iceland . Alaska is one of the few states that also has no native species.\nThe typical habitat is just as broad as where they can live. In water-based and land-based environments alike, these reptiles can also be found in tropical areas. While the water moccasin and the water snake commonly live near and in water, most snakes live on land. Based on the species, snakes can live in deserts , prairies,\ngrasslands , and the rainforest .\nDiet\nSnakes eat mice, birds, frogs, and lizards.\nThese reptiles have a carnivorous diet, meaning that their diet entirely consists of other animals. They can choose warm-blooded or cold-blooded animals, seeking out amphibians , insects , and mammals ; some species feed exclusively on other snakes and lizards.\nThough every snake will consume their prey whole, the way that they render them helpless varies. Boas and pythons will bite their prey to hold onto them, wrapping their body around and squeezing the life from the prey. If the animal has fangs, it will deliver venom to its prey. The venom comes from a sac that is hidden behind the eyes.\nPredators and Threats\nSnakes are relatively quick and effective predators, but they are also the prey of many different animals.\n©Megan Czarnocki/Shutterstock.com\nThese reptiles are relatively quick and effective predators, but they are also the prey of many different animals. One of the biggest predators of these reptiles is humans because some people hunt them for meat, clothing, and many other purposes. However, snakes in general aren’t considered endangered.\nThe population of these reptiles can be negatively impacted by deforestation, hunting, and climate change. Ultimately, the threat that the snake faces is specific to many factors, like the species, where they live, and how much meat they provide. Learn about some snakes that are endangered here .\nTo learn about some snakes that don’t bite, read here .\nWhat Eats Snakes?\nThese reptiles may be rather impressive hunters, but animals like large birds and coyotes have made these reptiles into a regular part of their diet.\nThey are also hunted by mongooses , wild boars , foxes , raccoons , and other game that can pick them up and consume them. Some snake species prey on other snakes – king snakes, indigo snakes, and king cobras are good examples.\nLuckily, each species has its own way to defend itself against threats. Camouflage plays a major role in their defense, hiding for additional coverage. Venomous species will bite as a last resort, but they generally try to flee instead.\nWhat Do Snakes Eat?\nSince all of these reptiles are carnivores, there are many small animals that can become their prey. The diet that the animal consumes is based on their species. Insects , amphibians , earthworms, slugs, fish , rodents, rabbits , and birds are all possible foods. Some snakes eat eggs .\nRead here to discover some snakes that eat fish and some snakes that eat birds .\nReproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nCobras eat other snakes but will eat birds\n©Roberto 33/Shutterstock.com\nThe reproduction process of these reptiles is primarily a process of internal fertilization. Most species intertwine their bodies with that of their partner, and the male releases the sperm from one of the two organs it has. The female doesn’t necessarily become pregnant with her young right away; some females can store the male’s sperm for 2-5 years before fertilization.\nThe species will determine the type of birth that the female has. Rattlesnakes and garter snakes give birth to their babies as they live young, which makes them ovoviviparous. However, species like the ball python and the corn snake lay eggs, making them oviparous. In fact, approximately 70% of all these reptiles are oviparous, rather than ovoviviparous.\nThe number of eggs or live young will vary greatly. For snakes that give birth to live young, about 10-30 are born in each litter, though the diamondback water snake can have up to 40 babies in a litter.\nThe live-bearing females often find a sheltered spot where they give birth to the babies. For the species that lay eggs, the clutch size varies significantly. While the ball python may only lay a single egg, some clutches are up to 100 eggs annually.\nThe species of snake determine their lifespan . While smaller species (like the garter snake) live for less than ten years, the various types of boas can leave for about 25 to 50 years.\nAs of September 2020, the longest-living snake is a ball python who is currently 62 years old and lives in the St. Louis Zoo of Missouri.\nPopulation\nWith over 4,000 types of snakes around the world, the total population varies from country to country.\n©Jukka Palm/Shutterstock.com\nWith over 4,000 types of snakes around the world, the total population varies from country to country. Interestingly, there are a few countries that have no known native species of snakes at all, including Antarctica . Here is a compilation of pre-historic snakes .\nAlthough most snakes are not dangerous to people, they are largely misunderstood and unpopular.\nThough there are some species with lower populations, snakes (as a whole) are classified as “not extinct ” by the IUCN. Here is a list of the most popular snakes in the world .\nRead about the rarest snakes in the world here.\nIn the Zoo\nThese reptiles can be found at nearly every major zoo, allowing the public to become more informed of the types of this reptile that span across the globe. Most often, the zoos will include snakes that are local to their region, so the species will vary from one location to the next.\nWhen visiting this reptile, most species will simply relax in their tank. However, some zoos (like the Virginia Living Museum ) feature demonstrations outside of the tanks to allow patrons to get a closer look. With more awareness of and information about snakes, the fear typically associated with these animals can be reduced.\nSnakes that live in zoos may not exhibit the same outward symptoms of illness that they show in the wild. Zookeepers are incredibly familiar with the behavior that these snakes show when they are ill, allowing them to get fast treatment when they become sick.\nSome types of snakes can be kept as pets , like the corn snake or the rosy boa.\nRead More\nSnakes that fit in a 20-gallon tank .\nSnakes that can Eat a Human .\nSnakes are vibrant creatures that display so many different colors.

And when it comes to islands, expensive tours to the Maldives , the Philippine Islands , or Italian beaches may be on top of your bucket list. But if you’re looking for less expensive and time-efficient island travel , why not try Texas ? Yes, you read that right. There are several must-visit islands in Texas. These are not golf courses on islands or little islands in lakes ; they are islands bordered by bays and the Gulf of Mexico . \nA group of barrier islands in the Gulf of Mexico that run along the Texas Gulf Coast is called the Texas barrier islands. These islands may appear to be one continuous chain from a distance, yet they are divided into separate regions with unique “personalities.” The appeal of these distinctions is increased because visitors can select the kind of island activities that suit their mood. Some of the Texas islands are the best places to meet other travelers, while others are the best places to escape civilization in favor of pristine nature completely. This article will show you the 10 most beautiful and must-visit Texas islands.\n10 Must-visit Islands in Texas\n1. Padre Island\nThe largest barrier island in the world is Padre Island.\n©iStock.com/RoschetzkyIstockPhoto\nPadre Island is perhaps among the most famous Texas islands, as it holds the title of the world’s largest barrier island , measuring 113 miles long and 1.8 miles wide. Apart from that, Padre Island is also renowned all over Texas and neighboring states for its gleaming white sands and pristine turquoise waters that seem to shimmer at the touch of sunlight . There is a lot to do on the island, including the Schlitterbahn Water Park, relaxing beach days, water sports, and, if you visit at the appropriate time, the chance to see the world’s most endangered species of sea turtle hatch.\nPadre Island is split into two destinations: South and North Padre Island. Each side boasts wonderful beaches and water activities to enjoy. Great restaurants, beaches, various entertaining things to do, housing options on the beach, camping, and entertaining beach bars make South Padre Island a popular vacation destination. In fact, South Padre Island is known as the “Beach Bar Capital of Texas!”\nNorth Padre Island differs from its bustling cousin to the south despite sharing a name. The island is the longest unexplored barrier island in the world at 70 miles long and is entirely undeveloped .\n2. Brazos Island\nBrazos Island is situated in Cameron County on the Texas Gulf Coast.\n©iStock.com/LeongKokWeng\nThe barrier island Brazos, often called Brazos Santiago Island, is situated in Cameron County on the Texas Gulf Coast. Although Brazos Island is no longer visible on any contemporary maps, it was the site of numerous engagements throughout the 1800s. It was a small, low-barrier island south of Padre Island that was significant in the Civil War. Before advancing on the Rio Grande Valley, Union General Napoleon Dana landed his forces on the island and fortified it. A significant storm damaged most depots’ structures in 1867, and the remnants finally vanished under the dunes along the coast. On the island, there is a small, unspoiled region called Brazos Island State Scenic Park, which offers swimming, camping, ocean fishing , surfing, and environmental research.\n3. San José Island\nSan José Island is a tiny private barrier island flanked by the Gulf of Mexico and Aransas Bay.\n©Kharker / CC BY-SA 3.0 – License\nUndeveloped beaches on San José Island teem with sea life and shells. This formerly ranch-like private island is now a nature refuge that can be reached by ferry. Located immediately off the northern tip of Mustang Island, San José Island is a tiny (21 miles long and 5 miles wide) private barrier island flanked by the Gulf of Mexico and Aransas Bay.\nTo find unusual seashells such as sand dollars , starfish , lightning whelks, shark eyes, angel wings, and other items, visitors must stay on the beach below the vegetation line, which is ideal for shelling, fishing, birding, and beach combing.\n4. Galveston Island\nGalveston is renowned as a base for piracy and the importation of enslaved people.\n©iStock.com/Eric Overton\nGalveston Island, south of Houston, is probably well-known to everyone. It is renowned as a base for piracy and the importation of enslaved people. It is 27 miles long and no wider than 3 miles. Historical homes and exciting seaside activities coexist on this barrier island. Galveston Island is a short trip from one end to the other, but there are many attractions on the island.\nWhether you’re traveling with kids, are curious about the region’s interesting history, want to spend the entire day on the boardwalk, or prefer sunset cruises, you won’t run out of things to do. Galveston Island’s distinctive architecture, house tours, boats, beach relaxation, ecotourism, dolphin and whale watching, and museums appeal to families and couples.\n5. Follet’s Island\nFollet’s Island is one of a group of barrier islands that stretch along the majority of the Texas coast.\n©OpenStreetMap editors (map), Bryan Rutherford (edit & labels) / CC BY-SA 4.0 – License\nIn Brazoria County, Texas, just southwest of Galveston Island on the Texas Gulf Coast, is a barrier island called Follet’s Island. It is one of a group of barrier islands that stretch along the majority of the Texas coast and divides the Christmas Bay system from the Gulf of Mexico.\n6. Mustang Island\nAbout 177 miles north of Houston, Mustang Island is near Padre Island in the Gulf of Mexico.\n©iStock.com/ShengYing Lin\nMustang Island is yet another stunning barrier island in Texas. This island is near Padre Island in the Gulf of Mexico, about 177 miles north of Houston. Mustang Island, a Gulf island with more than 18 miles of barrier-island shoreline, is worth visiting for its wildlife, beaches, and marine sanctuaries. The island is a well-liked spring break and summer vacation spot for several reasons.\nMustang Island State Park, which has more than five miles of coastline, is one of its key attractions. You are welcome to swim, surf, and fish in this state park and enjoy all the other benefits of hanging out on an island in Texas. The beaches are stunning, the sea is teeming with vibrant fish, and there is even a resort village to give you the impression that you are in a tropical paradise .\n7. Matagorda Island\nMatagorda Island, Galveston’s far less populated sister island, is the ideal location if you want to spend a calm beach day away from intrusive tourists. Matagorda sits roughly seven miles south of Port O’Connor and is long and narrow. The island is a 56,688-acre wildlife management area between eight and a half miles long and four miles wide.\nIt is renowned for its seclusion, untainted natural beauty, a lighthouse built in 1852, a myriad of migratory birds , including 19 species listed as endangered by state or federal authorities, and an abundant population of white-tailed deer , alligators , and other wildlife. On the island, there are a lot of wildlife refuges, so you might observe some fascinating, endangered species you have never seen before.\n8. Ward Island\nWard Island is a tiny, triangular island located about four hours from Houston and is one of Texas’s islands with the lowest population density and rich military history. A favorite among history aficionados, Ward Island is situated right offshore of Corpus Christi and played an important role during World War II.\nThe deserted island was converted into the Naval Air Technical Training Center at the start of the war, where technicians received training in the use of radar and other vital electronic devices. Since the center’s closure in 1947, the island has been home to Texas A&M’s Corpus Christi branch, whose stunning campus makes it worthwhile to visit on its own.\nAlthough A&M’s Corpus Christi uses the island primarily, visitors are still permitted, and many take advantage of the chance to appreciate the tranquility and beauty of this island . Biking, hiking, and fishing are the three most popular activities on the island.\n9. Pelican Island\nIf you want to understand more about the state’s maritime heritage, go to Pelican Island. Texas A&M Galveston, as well as two Navy vessel memorials, are located on Pelican Island, which was formerly a marsh region before it was transformed into a 5.4 square-foot island as a part of the city of Galveston. In Seawolf Park, both ships have been transformed into public museums.\nThe American Undersea Warfare Center, commonly known as the Galveston Naval Center, is only found on Pelican Island. The Island is a great location for festivals, beaches, art and history museums, bird viewing, fishing, and seasonal festivities.\n10. Pine Island\nEnough about the museums, wildlife viewing, and natural beaches. Let’s explore an island known for its fishing and boating opportunities this time. A man-made reservoir on the Trinity River in Texas called Lake Livingston includes an island named Pine Island. It is located inside the confines of Texas’ San Jacinto County. Boats are anchored offshore at Pine Island; on the other hand, there are no services here.\nUp Next:\n7 Islands That No One Can Visit\n10 Most Dangerous Islands in the World\nNo One Lives Here: 10 Uninhabited Islands From Across the World\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

It’s technically not impossible, but it’s a difficult proposition. Not only does your runaway island need to lack a governing country , but it also needs to not be some kind of national monument or conservatory.\nA country claims almost anything that resembles land above the water’s surface. That’s because international law dictates that the ocean surrounding land masses is governed by the owner of that land mass, and grabbing islands is a matter of oceanic control.\nSo great is the urge by major world players to own all of the locations on the planet that they’ve used satellites to identify otherwise unidentifiable land for the sake of ownership. There are even rules around how land in outer space should be treated regarding land rights.\nAre there any unclaimed islands left in the world ? Surprisingly, yes, there are a few. What are 3 unclaimed islands? Can I establish my own country? Can I claim a kingdom in outer space?\nWe’ll dive into these questions and more below.\nWhat is Terra Nullius?\nTerra nullius is the idea that land you find and then settle first becomes yours.\n©iStock.com/aroxopt\nTerra nullius is the idea that unoccupied land can be claimed by occupying it. It’s somewhat like an antiquated idea used in areas under international law when a sovereign nation wants to lay claim to something.\nIf you found an unclaimed island, the way you’d take it is through the idea of terra nullius . You settled it first after finding it, and you get to claim it.\n3 Unclaimed Islands\nThese are 3 places to find unclaimed islands across the world:\nLagoan Isles\nAny Island in Mary Byrd Land\nIslands that Appear and Disappear in the Pacific Ocean\n1. Lagoan Isles\nA teacher noticed that these islands weren’t mentioned in a UK sales contract when the land changed hands, so he declared himself the Grand Duke of the Lagoan Isles successfully in 2005.\nThe islands are uninhabited , and the website has gone down. That means these little islands in Baffins Pond in the city of Portsmouth in England are up for grabs. There is no bridge across the pond to the islands, so if you’re going to claim it, you’ll have to boat or swim.\n2. Any Island in Mary Byrd Land\nMary Byrd land is a wedge of unclaimed territory in Antarctica. It is the largest chunk of unclaimed land in the world, and that’s because it’s pretty much uninhabitable . With the right supplies, however, it’s not beyond comprehension that you could establish your own country here.\nThere’s nothing in Mary Byrd Land that anyone else has found worth claiming. It is mostly tundra dotted with volcanoes, and it’s too remote for anyone to find useful. Except maybe you if you’re looking to find an unclaimed island.\nByrd Station, owned by the US, does sit in Mary Byrd land, though the US has not laid claim to the entire area.\n3. Islands that Appear and Disappear In the Pacific Ocean\nVolcanic activity in the Pacific Ocean creates islands that theoretically could be claimed.\n©Wead/Shutterstock.com\nSome islands appear and disappear in the Pacific Ocean due to volcanic activity. Some of these islands are in international waters; therefore, they theoretically can be claimed by any country.\nGood luck establishing ownership before another country swoops in and claims it for their own. There are satellite monitoring systems set up to find these islands as they appear.\nCan I Claim Land on Other Planets?\nNo, you cannot claim land on other planets. There are already laws in place governing whether or not you can claim extra-terrestrial land, and the answer is you can’t. Nations are not allowed to claim outer space.\nThat doesn’t stop people from trying, however.\nDennis Hope wrote the United Nations claiming the moon in the 1960s. Since they never wrote him back, he proceeded with his notion of ownership. He has sold 600 million acres of moon land for about $20 per acre.\nCan I Make Up Laws I Enforce on a Private Island?\nIf you purchase an island that’s already a part of a country, you cannot establish your own laws.\n©NASA / public domain\nYou cannot set up laws on your private island, but you can establish rules.\nWhile claiming an uncharted island might be out of the question, owning an island is more obtainable. There are plenty of islands around the world that are for sale .\nThat doesn’t mean owning land is the same as possessing a sovereign nation. Any island that is bought and sold belongs to some governing body, which is most likely a country.\nEven some of the most isolated islands in the world, like those found in the most northern sections of Svalbard, all have someone who lays claim to them. That technically puts them under the jurisdiction of someone, which means that you can’t establish laws on your private island.\nThat doesn’t mean you can’t establish rules as long as they don’t violate the presiding country’s laws or any human rights. However, sounds like a gray area? It is.\nWhat is a Micronation?\nA micronation is an entity that declares its sovereignty but isn’t recognized by the larger international community. It’s plausible that any part of the world can be declared a micronation at any time by determined individuals, but not many places in the world will tolerate such claims and leave them uncontested.\nSealand is an abandoned platform used in WWII in the North Sea that is a micronation. It was established in 1967 on a floating British gun tower that remained afloat after the war. A man named Paddy Roy Bates declared himself the prince, and the British have never officially disputed this.\nCan I Create a Country Without Land?\nNo, you need land to create a country. While one exception kind of exists that violates this, they still have areas of land that they control.\nIt’s not their land, so the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, that’s recognized as a country, doesn’t have any territory that they call their own. They have a governing body, including all of the entrapments needed to be a country, like passports, but their buildings are not on foreign soil.\nUp Next:\n7 Islands That No One Can Visit\n10 Most Dangerous Islands in the World\nNo One Lives Here: 10 Uninhabited Islands From Across the World\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

These boneless predators prey on little fishes, sea horses, and other smaller animals of the ocean’s vast ecosystem, and occasionally humans.\nThough shark attacks are rare, they happen yearly around the world and can be fatal, given that they range from 4 inches to about 50 feet long. In this article, we’re going to show you 7 islands with the most shark attacks in the world.\nThe World Islands with the Most Shark Attacks\nWhile sharks live in the ocean’s depths, they are often found close to the coastlines of islands worldwide. The islands with the most shark attacks are as follows:\nReunion Island, Indian Ocean\nBetween 1913 and 2018, there have been 56 shark attacks, with 27 being fatal on Reunion Island.\n©julienjanusko/Shutterstock.com\nThe French Island is located in the dangerous ‘ Shark Highway ’ in the Indian Ocean , with Madagascar to its west and Mauritius to its northeast. The island finds itself in shark-infested waters , with its aquatic ecosystem and coral reefs making its coastlines appealing to sharks to inhabit. It is little wonder that residents and tourists on Reunion Island have been banned from swimming in the waters around the island to curb shark attacks.\nAccording to the Annual Worldwide Shark Attack Summary by Forbes , there have been 56 shark attacks, with 27 being fatal on Reunion Island between 1913 and 2018. The island is known to have the highest ratio of shark-related deaths per a million people in the world, more than South Africa , which comes close second, and the United States of America .\nLong Island, USA\nThe most commonly sighted sharks along Long Island are the aggressive Great White Sharks.\n©iStock.com/Jin Huang\nAbout half of the world’s recorded shark attacks in recent years have occurred around the United States of America. The New York Island is densely populated, with the frequent use of the coastlines by residents and tourists taken as one of the factors for the frequency of shark attacks in the region.\nShark attacks haven’t always been plentiful on Long Island. However, in July 2022, there were at least three attacks . Long Island extends into the Atlantic Ocean , from where sharks swim to its coastlines. The warm and clear waters, and the availability of fish prey for sharks, influence the abundance of sharks off the island’s coast. The most commonly sighted sharks along Long Island are the aggressive great white sharks .\nOther commonly sighted shark species include tiger sharks, which use the island’s estuaries as a habitat for juvenile sharks during summer, basking sharks, and blue sharks. It is worth noting that hunting sharks on Long Island is considered illegal.\nMaui Island, Hawaii\nMaui Island has had the most shark attacks of all the Hawaiian Islands; about 70 reported attacks on its coastlines.\n©iStock.com/mihtiander\nMaui Island has had the most shark attacks of all the Hawaiian Islands ; about 70 reported shark attacks on its coastlines, with Makena Beach having the most attacks. The shark-infested island ranks after Hawaii Island as the second largest in the state with a landmass of 727.2 square miles (1,883 square kilometers). While the coastlines attract tourists annually, it also makes for a suitable habitat for sharks.\nThe most commonly spotted shark on the coastlines of Maui Island is the tiger shark . Tiger sharks are considered aggressive alongside their cousins, the bull shark and the great white, which are likely to attack humans unprovoked. Other shark species around the island include cookie-cutter sharks, Galapagos, sandbars, and grey reef sharks .    \nBig Island, Hawaii\nSharks of different species are drawn to the island’s coastlines like the other big Hawaiian islands.\n©iStock.com/Jonathan Ross\nNicknamed the Big Island, Hawaii Island spans 4,028 square miles (10,432.5 square kilometers) and is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean. As its name implies, it is the biggest island in America .\nSharks of different species are drawn to the coastlines of the island like the other big Hawaiian Islands, as the state of Hawaii is known to have about 40 shark species in its waters. Between 2020 and 1995, there have been about 22 shark attacks on the Big Island.\nKona Beach is one of the most popular beaches on Big Island and consequently has more shark attacks than the other beaches. \nOahu Island, Hawaii\nOahu Island has the second highest shark attacks of the 137 Hawaiian Islands.\n©iStock.com/okimo\nOahu Island has the second highest shark attacks of the 137 Hawaiian Islands. The Central Pacific island has had about 42 recorded shark attacks, with many of them on Kamala Beach. The ocean predators are known to frequent the island’s shallow waters for its suitable conditions and shallow waters.\nThe most common shark species sighted around the island include the aggressive tiger shark, the whitetip reef shark, the scalloped hammerhead , and the Galapagos. To curb shark attacks on the island, hunting of sharks has been declared illegal , with water sports activities prohibited in some areas around the island.\nPapua New Guinea, New Guinea\nPapua New Guinea is known to have had about 48 unprovoked shark attacks since the year 1848.\n©iStock.com/GenDeschenes\nPapua New Guinea sits in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, in the continent of Oceania. New Guinea is considered the largest tropical island in the world, spanning 178,700 square miles (462,840 square kilometers). This island is known to have had about 48 unprovoked shark attacks since the year 1848.\nOne of the major reasons for shark attacks around the island is fishing and diving in the Papua New Guinea waters. Some natives are known to practice an act called ‘shark calling’ to lure sharks closer to their boats and capture them. The depletion of sharks in the island’s waters has stirred a debate, with the natives being accused of hunting sharks excessively. In contrast, the natives believe that the depletion of the sharks is due to sea mining by commercial entities.\nThe commonly sighted shark species in the island waters include river sharks, great white sharks, mako sharks, and epaulette sharks.\nFraser Island, Australia\nThe shallow waters at the beaches of the Australian island are infested by Great White Sharks, Tiger Sharks, Reef Sharks, and Bull Sharks.\n©iStock.com/wWeiss Lichtspiele\nFraser Island is the sixth largest island in Australia and the largest sand island in the world. The East Australian Island, which spans about 710 square miles, is considered a World Heritage-listed island. Its rainforests, mangroves, dunes, woodlands, diverse birds, and beaches make it a popular destination for tourists and sharks.\nThe shallow waters at the beaches of the Australian island are infested by great white sharks, tiger sharks, reef sharks, and bull Sharks, among other shark species. The east line of the island is the most shark-infested area, and humans are strongly advised to stay away. The last reported shark attack on the coast of Fraser Island was in the year 2020 of a man spearfishing in the Indian Ocean.\nHow to Avoid Sharks in the Ocean\nWhile the risk of being bitten by a shark is close to zilch, it is important to take caution when in the sea or ocean, as it is not easy to identify shark species underwater. Sharks have very keen tracking senses under the water; they can smell blood for miles underwater and sense vibrations. \nSome quarters advise that when faced with a shark, you should punch the shark in the nose to turn the predators away. However, a better option is to flee from the water and onto land.\nMore proactive measures are to adhere to Nature Signs, avoiding waters with high shark activity and areas with clusters of seals that could also attract sharks.  \nA shark’s bite can be fatal no matter what part of the body the bite is taken from, so get to the nearest hospital as quickly as possible if bitten by one. \nUp Next:\n7 Islands That No One Can Visit\n10 Most Dangerous Islands in the World\nNo One Lives Here: 10 Uninhabited Islands From Across the World\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

They are largely defined by their language groups. Many Alaska Natives are members of 13 regional organizations that oversee land and financial claims.\nThousands of years ago, Native Alaskans arrived in two waves. Some are from the third immigrant wave to northern North America — no southward migration. Genetic testing shows they are not linked to indigenous South Americans. Anthropologists say they could only have traveled to Alaska via the Bering land bridge or sea route.\nAlaska Native ancestors created multiple indigenous, sophisticated cultures in the Arctic and circumpolar north. They created clever solutions to make it through the difficult climate and environment. Historical communities are defined by languages from many main language families. More than 20% of Alaskans are Alaska Natives.\nAlaska’s rough climate and environment was difficult for Alaska Native ancestors to traverse.\n©iStock.com/mscornelius\nName\nThe word “Eskimo” has fallen out of favor due to its negative connotations and has been replaced by “Inuit” in both Canada and Greenland. On the other hand, the word “Eskimo” is still acceptable and, in some cases, favored as a collective noun among certain Alaska Natives of Inupiaq (Inuit) and Yupik descent.\nAll the Alaska Native or Native Alaskan peoples are listed here, with their historic languages and the various tribes that make up each civilization: Alaskan Athabaskans , Ancestral Beringians, Eskimoes, Eyak, Gwich’in, Haida, Hän, Holikachuk, Inupiat (Inuit), Koyukon, Lower Tanana, Tanacross, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Upper Kuskokwim (Kolchan), Upper Tanana, Yupik (Unangan), and Yup’ik.\nLocation\nBefore the 1890s and 1900s gold rushes, Americans and Europeans had limited contact with Alaska Natives. The 1887 Dawes Act did not grant Alaska Natives individual titles in severalty; the 1906 Alaska Native Allotment Act did. Vitus Bering discovered Alaska. 18th-century Russians first met Alaskans. Since Alaskan Native groups were separated, their interactions with Russians varied. Middle-18th-century Russians sailed from Siberia to the Aleutian Islands to trade with Alaska Natives.\nRussian Orthodox missionaries settled near trading posts. Russian missionaries translated the Bible into Tlingit first. This early legacy is reflected in the substantial number of Russian Orthodox Christian congregations in Alaska. The Russian Tsarist government invaded Native Alaskan land for geopolitical reasons. During trading years, it drained natural resources and evangelized Russian Orthodoxy.\nTheir arrival into highly populated Indigenous nations changed demographics and topography. Alaska’s resources were plentiful. Alaska’s natural wealth, including gold, drew U.S. attention. In 1867, the United States gained Alaska from Russia but Native Alaskans’ wishes weren’t considered, and they weren’t citizens. White settlers could seize Alaska Natives’ land without compensating them. Only missionaries could educate Alaska Natives. White immigrants thought Alaska Natives were less intellectual than European Americans and didn’t understand their sophisticated traditions.\nPopulation\nRoughly 86,000 Alaska Natives called Alaska home in 1990, with another 17,000 living elsewhere, according to the Alaska Natives Commission. According to a study conducted in 2013 by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development, there are more than 120,000 Alaska Natives in the state. The bulk of Native Alaskans live in outlying regional hubs like Nome, Dillingham, and Bethel, but the percentage of the population residing in metropolitan areas has been increasing. The percentage of people living in cities increased from 38% in 2000 to 44% in 2010. In 2018, Alaska’s indigenous population made up 15.4% of the state’s overall population.\nBeliefs\nTraditional Native Alaskan religions center on interactions with the afterlife and the spirits of the departed. These beliefs and practices were once widespread among the peoples of the Arctic, especially the Inuit (including the Inupiat), the Yupik, the Aleut, and the Northwest Coastal Indian tribes. By the time the first serious ethnological research was done, they were already on the decline in many communities. By the end of the 19th century, for instance, Sagdloq, the last traditional healer of the people then known as “Polar Eskimos” in English, had died. He was rumored to have the ability to fly or dive through the floor of the ocean, and he was famous for his sleight of hand and ventriloquism.\nCulture\nNative Alaskan traditions have a profound impact on our daily lives, from the names of mountains , rivers , and communities in traditional areas to the architecture, art, and culture of our urban centers. Alaska is home to around 730,000 people, 15% of whom are Native Americans from 20 diverse cultural groups speaking 300 different dialects. Many Alaska Natives in the scattered communities dot the river and coast of the state and sustain on traditional means, hunting and fishing. All five of Alaska’s geographic areas, as well as its main cities and small towns, have been inspired by the Alaska Native people’s language, storytelling, artwork, customs, and ceremonies.\nWhen Europeans arrived in Alaska, modern history truly got underway for the indigenous people who lived there. Unusually for North America , the initial contact was made in the 18th century by Russians sailing from Siberia. It wasn’t until the seventeenth century that British and American merchants, particularly from eastern North American cities, began to make their way to the region. It wasn’t until the 20th century that Christian missionaries began arriving in Alaska. The ancestry of the Alaska Native people can be traced back to the first individuals to traverse the Bering Land Bridge across Asia to North America.\nNative Alaskans make up about 15% of the state’s current population but belong to any of 229 recognized tribes. Others have adopted Western ways of life while many others still rely on subsistence hunting and fishing. The indigenous people of Alaska are divided into 11 distinct cultural groups. These cultures are categorized according to their shared customs, languages, and geographic locations. The state’s cultural diversity is one of its defining characteristics, ranging from the indigenous Tlingit in the Inside Passage to the Inupiat of the Arctic Slope.\nLanguage\nThere are roughly 20 distinct languages spoken in Alaska, with the vast majority being members of just two families. They are the Na-Dene and the Inuit-Unangan (sometimes called Eskimo-Aleut) (a.k.a. Athabaskan-Eyak-Tlingit). The Aleut language is a subset of the Eskimo-Aleut language family, along with the Inuit and Yup’ik languages. (There are differing opinions on whether the Sirenik Eskimo language should be classified as a Yupik language or a separate group altogether.) Since its founding in 1972 by the Alaska Legislature, the Alaska Native Language Center has collected and documented Alaska’s Native languages.\nThe lineage of Alaska Natives may be traced back to two major migrations that occurred thousands of years ago. There are numerous Native American tribes, but there are primarily six that make up the bulk of the population. These include the Aleut, Tsimshian, Inupiat, Tlingit-Haida, and Yup’ik. While the Native American population was concentrated in a relatively small number of communities, its members spoke more than 300 distinct languages.\nUp Next:\nA Guide to the Aleut Tribe: Location, Population, and More\nAnimals in Alaska\nThe Longest Biking Trail in Alaska\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

Visitors to the park in May 2020 received a front-row seat to a battle between some of the biggest mammals in the park. A juvenile grizzly bear was trying to take down a young bison all by itself. Yet, the powerful bison takes the grizzly bear for a long walk first.\nGrizzly bears are large creatures, weighing upwards of 600 pounds as grown adults, and bison can weigh over 2,00 pounds ! Neither of these animals was fully grown, though. The grizzly picked on a bison its own size.\nThe video opens with the bear walking on its hind legs with its forelegs resting on the bison’s back as it tries to deliver a deadly bite. Bears often seek to incapacitate their prey by biting their neck or backbones. In this case, the bison’s large head and shaggy fur protect its head and neck. The bear goes for the backbone instead.\nThe bison does not seem too bothered by the ordeal and shrugs the bear off for a moment. The bear takes a few seconds to collect itself and then goes back to work, biting at the sides and back of the bison while trying to wear it down.\nMeanwhile, the bison, giving no apparent sign that it’s in distress, decides to try walking away with the weight of the bear pressing down upon it. Meanwhile, the person behind the camera talks with other passersby, saying that it would be a “heck of a spot for a kill.” Apparently, a group of hikers was due to return to the area around that time.\nThe bear tries its best to maul the bison, and the young, powerful bison takes it for a walk. They walk across a field, over a bridge, and down to the banks of a river. Meanwhile, the bear systematically removes fur from the bison’s back.\nEventually, the current takes both creatures, and they float downriver and away from the camera. The cameraman goes over to where the attack began and zooms in on a bunch of bison fur that was sheared off by the bear’s teeth.\nThe grizzly’s relentless assault continues and becomes more vicious as the bison tries to regain its footing on the riverbank. Although they’re far from the camera, it’s clear that the bison is running out of strength as the grizzly tears into its hindquarters. At that point, every time the bear pulls itself onto the bison’s back, it sends the hapless creature’s body underwater.\nThe video ends without commentary as the attack continues. However, the video description says that the bear ultimately won the fight. Given the situation and size of the creatures, we can only assume that the young bear killed the powerful bison. Its hunt will serve as valuable experience in the years to come.\nMeanwhile, the people filming the assault got a great reminder of the power of nature even in a national park.\nUp Next: More Encounters with Powerful Bison and Bears\nDo you want to see more videos of large bears?

Volcanic explosions aren’t common, and yet a sleeping volcano is coming to life after 800 years. Although rare, even dormant volcanos can show signs of activity. Follow along to learn about Mount Edgecumbe, an inactive volcano showing signs of waking up.\nAbout Mt. Edgecumbe\nMount Edgecumbe is at the southern end of Kruzof Island, Alaska . It’s about 9.9 miles east of the Queen Charlotte Fault. The elevation of this mount is 3,201 feet. Although this large volcano sits close to cities and homes, it hasn’t had a major eruption in over 4000 years. The indigenous Tlingit people lived near the mountain. They called it “L’ux”, which means “to flash” or “blinking”. It’s likely they discovered the mountain while it was smoking or erupting.\nMount Edgecumbe is a unique mountain. The first recorded ascent was in 1805 by Captain Urey Lisianski. The hiking trail is about 6.8 miles long and ends with the snow-covered ground and red volcanic ash above the treeline. Hikers can also choose to hike to the crater rim. The trail isn’t barren. Instead, a three-sided cabin sits four miles up the trail. The trail is not as hard as others and is listed as moderate. However, the last three miles to the top are steep and can be muddy. Hikers may also run into bears as they are common in the area.\nAlthough the volcano hasn’t seen a massive eruption in over 4,000 years, a hoax did scare many Sitka, Alaska residents. Oliver “Porky” Bickar, a local prankster, planned this prank for over four years. He lit over 70 old tires in the crater causing dark smoke to rise. This looked like an eruption, however, at the rim of the volcano, the local prankster spray painted “April Fool”. The FAA and the Sitka Police Department were notified beforehand. It is considered one of the ten best Aprils Fools hoaxes of all time.\nAlthough the earthquakes occurred in 2020, magma has been rising every year since 2018 about 3.4 inches per year. While magma may be rising in the volcano, there are no signs it will erupt.\n©Steve Heap/Shutterstock.com\nIs Mt. Edgecumbe Coming to Life?\nWhile Mt. Edgecumbe has been inactive for 800 to 900 years, scientists have noted some signs that it could be coming back to life. For example, the mountain experienced a small swarm of earthquakes . Scientists began monitoring the activity and noted deformities at the surface level of the volcano. There was a 10.5 inch change. It’s likely the change is because of rising magma. Scientists discovered this using a new analysis system. Although the earthquakes occurred in 2020, magma has been rising every year since 2018 about 3.4 inches per year. While magma may be rising in the volcano, there are no signs it will erupt.\nSigns a Volcano May Erupt\nVolcanos are interesting, they don’t always erupt over thousands of years. Instead, sometimes volcanos erupt quickly. The quickest eruption took less than an hour. So, how do we know when a volcano may erupt? The most common signs a volcano might erupt are magma rising to the surface, swelling and cracking of the ground surface, and an increase in intense and frequent earthquakes. Usually, volcanos show signs of erupting, so it’s unlikely Mt. Edgecumbe is close to erupting.\nMount St. Helens has erupted multiple times. It remains active and the worst eruption was in 1980.\n©iStock.com/GoAnywherePhoto\nActive Volcanoes Around the World\nWhile volcanic eruptions are rare, there are still active volcanoes all around the world. For example, there are approximately 1,350 likely active volcanoes worldwide. An active volcano near Seattle and Portland is Mount St. Helens. This volcano is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc with over 160 other active volcanos. Mount St. Helens has erupted multiple times. It remains active and the worst eruption was in 1980. During this eruption, 57 people were killed. Not only were people killed, but about 250 homes, 47 bridges, 185 miles of highway, and 15 miles of railways were completely destroyed. The eruption was caused by a strong 5.1 earthquake which resulted in a debris avalanche. It also changed the mountain summit’s height from 9,677 feet to 8,365 feet.\nAnother active volcano is Mount Merapi, which is an active stratovolcano . It is located in Indonesia which has over 100 active volcanoes. It is very active and frequent eruptions are common. Mount Merapi is so active, it’s common to see smoke coming out of the mountaintop. On October 25, 2010, the volcano erupted killing about 353 people in one month. Another 350,000 fled their homes, which were destroyed by pyroclastic flows and heavy rainfall.\nAlso in Indonesia, Mount Semeru erupted in 2021. This dangerous eruption killed at least 69 people and left 104 people injured. The oldest record of eruption for this volcano dates back to 1818. Even as recently as 2022, Mount Semeru erupted which led to evacuations because of monsoon rains that collapsed the mountain’s lava dome.\nMount Merapi is so active, it’s common to see smoke coming out of the mountaintop.\n©Gani_Prastowo/Shutterstock.com\nUp Next:\n10 Important Mountains In The Bible\n8 Extinct Volcanoes from Across the World\n10 Awesome Mountains In Michigan\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

As an April 11 zodiac sign, your fiery personality is likely thanks to your Aries season date of birth! But astrology is only one part of interpreting your specific birthday. There are plenty of symbols, numbers, and astrological influences to consider.\nIf you’re interested in learning more about your April 11th birthday, you’re in the right place. Not only will we discuss what it’s like to be an Aries sun, but we’ll also talk in-depth about what it’s like to have an April 11th birthday. From your specific date’s numerological significance to how your birthday might influence your romantic life, here’s what you should know about being an April 11 zodiac sign!\nApril 11 Zodiac Sign: Aries\nAries suns embody new beginnings with their courage, energy, and innocent ways of being.\n©iStock.com/Allexxandar\nHeralding spring and all of its newness, Aries suns represent rebirth, curiosity, and growth. This is the very first sign of the zodiac, and they are a cardinal fire sign at that. These two things in conjunction have much to say about an Aries, particularly one born on April 11th. Aries suns embody new beginnings and starts with their courage, energy, and innocent ways of being. But did you know that many Aries behave differently from each other, for a number of reasons?\nNot only does your entire birth chart (including your moon sign, rising sign, and many other placements) affect your personality. The decans of the zodiac also factor into why you might behave differently from an Aries born on another day during Aries season. Each sun sign can be further broken down and secondarily ruled by signs belonging to the same element. Confused? Let’s take a closer look!\nThe Decans of Aries\nAs the days pass during Aries season (March 21st to April 19th, typically), there are secondary planetary influences as the season progresses. Depending on your birthday, you may have influence from Aries’s primary planet, Mars, as well as a second influence from either the sun (ruling Leo) or Jupiter (ruling Sagittarius). Here’s how the specific decans of Aries break down with corresponding birthdays:\nThe Aries decan . First chunk of Aries season, represented solely by Mars. This means that people born during this decan (roughly March 21st to March 30th, depending on the calendar year) present as classic, independent, and curious Aries suns.\nThe Leo decan . Second portion of Aries season, represented by both Mars and secondarily by the sun. This means that people born during this decan (March 31st to April 9th typically) have additional Leo personality traits . This may make them more creative, self-centered, and people-oriented compared to other Aries.\nThe Sagittarius decan . Third and final chunk of Aries season, represented by both Mars and secondarily by Jupiter. This means that people born during this decan (April 10th to April 19th on average) have additional Sagittarius personality traits. This may make them more freedom-oriented, optimistic, and blunt compared to other Aries.\nWith all of this in mind, it’s safe to say that an April 11 zodiac sign belongs to the third and final Aries decan. This gives you a fantastic placement and association with Jupiter, the planet that appears to make more Sagittarians extremely lucky. Let’s learn more about both Mars and Jupiter now.\nRuling Planets of an April 11 Zodiac\nTelling an Aries what to do will never go well for you, and we all have Mars to thank for that!\n©iStock.com/Cobalt88\nIt should come as no surprise to learn that Mars presides over Aries, given the average Aries personality. In a birth chart, Mars is in charge of our actions, instincts, drive, and aggression. When a sign is a Mars native, it often makes them incredibly ambitious, driven, and looking for control. While Mars rules both Scorpio and Aries, it manifests very differently in both of these signs.\nThe average Aries brings a boundless energy and vibrance to everything they do. This is also a sign that is notorious for their anger, aggression, and need for control. While a Scorpio enjoys controlling their environment and the people around them, Aries need control over only themselves, in every moment of life. Telling an Aries what to do will never go well for you, and we all have Mars to thank for that!\nBut it isn’t only Mars we need to look to for some insight into an April 11th birthday. Given their third decan placement and association with Sagittarius, Jupiter plays a smaller , secondary role in this person’s life. An Aries born on April 11th might be luckier, more optimistic, and invested in freedom more than other Aries suns. Why? Because Jupiter is associated with all of these things.\nOne of our social planets, Jupiter presides over our expansive abilities, including our capacities for generosity, travel, and positive outlooks. It is a “lucky” planet in many ways, though it is incredibly easy for Jupiter to dream a little too big! An April 11th zodiac sign only has a slight influence from this large planet, but it’s still large enough to make this person more devoted to freedom and interested in expanding, likely both personally and professionally.\nApril 11: Numerology and Other Associations\nFreedom is incredibly important to the stubborn ram, something that an Aries understands all too well!\n©Jesus Noguera photography/Shutterstock.com\nThere are many reasons why Aries is associated with the ram. The constellation of Aries has long been symbolized by the ram, and the literal symbol for Aries is quite a likeness to the horns of a ram. When you consider the actual animal that Aries is associated with, a lot of similarities come to mind.\nFor example, rams are incredibly courageous, headstrong, and independent animals. They utilize their inner resources to reach their goals, and their goals are often ambitious. Freedom is incredibly important to the stubborn ram, something that an Aries (especially one born in the third decan) understands all too well!\nBesides a connection to this iconic horned animal, an April 11th Aries should turn to numerology. When we add the digits of your day of birth, we get the number 2. This is a special number to have associated with you, given that the average Aries values independence more than most things. However, the number 2 is associated with partnerships, relationships, and harmony, which may make an April 11th Aries more interested in spending time with others.\nThe second house in astrology is well-associated with value, but this value can manifest differently depending on who you are. As an Aries so closely connected to the number 2, you may find that your values become part of what you strive for. Whether it’s money, relationships, or personal goals, the number 2 can help you reach these things with compromise and harmonic interactions!\nApril 11 Zodiac: Personality and Traits of an Aries\nThe average Aries personality is interested in the new, the exciting, the vibrant.\n©iStock.com/Evheniia Vasylenko\nAries are fire signs with cardinal modalities. Fire signs are well-known for their energy capacities, extroverted natures, and fierce opinions. Cardinal signs echo this behavior in a unique way, as these signs represent instigation, new ideas, and implementation of said ideas. All cardinal signs of the zodiac fall as the seasons are changing, representing the dawning of a new, powerful season!\nThis is incredibly obvious when we look at Aries, the first sign of the zodiac well-associated with springtime. The average Aries personality is interested in the new, the exciting, the vibrant. While this can sometimes get them into trouble when it comes to commitment, an Aries faces each day as if it is new, as if there is something out there that is only meant for them.\nEach sign of the zodiac represents a different age or time of our lives as well. Given that Aries begin our astrological wheel, they represent birth or infancy. This manifests in an Aries personality in many ways. It lends an April 11th Aries plenty of curiosity, innocence, and passion for discovery, also thanks to their Jupiter influence.\nThe average Aries may also enjoy a bit of doting or caretaking in their lives. They are the newborns of the zodiac, after all! Despite the fierce and independent exterior of an Aries, this sign needs to be looked after by those closest to them in order to feel fully accepted and loved. There is a lot of insecurity beneath the surface of an Aries, something to keep in mind should you ever interact with one.\nStrengths and Weaknesses of Aries\nEmotional capacities are boundless in an Aries, for better or worse.\n©Tanya Antusenok/Shutterstock.com\nAn April 11th Aries has a boundless capacity for new ideas, passions, and people. This is an extroverted person who loves discovering new obsessions and interests. However, this obsession can best be described as fleeting. The average Aries struggles to stick with something for very long, especially once that initial fire has burned out (all cardinal signs struggle with this concept).\nHowever, the energy of an Aries means they have endless means of discovering and obsessing over something new. This changeable nature is admirable, especially because an April 11th Aries never does anything halfway. Even if they devote their energies to something new, this is a person who commits to their new interest fully before they move on.\nEmotional capacities are also boundless in an Aries, for better or worse. This is a person who feels everything, all of the time. Not only do they express their emotions in a straightforward (and often extremely helpful!) way, but they feel their emotions in their entirety. While it is admirable to know someone who’s capable of plumbing their emotional depths, it can be a bit of a whirlwind to witness such incredible emotional displays that often don’t last very long!\nAnger and defensiveness are both potential weaknesses in an Aries. An April 11th Aries has the confidence and freedom to defend their point of view to the very end, but this potentially means that they are missing out on someone else’s valid point of view. However, with such connections to the number 2, an April 11th Aries likely values compromise more than the average ram!\nBest Career Choices for an April 11 Zodiac\nAthletic careers or performances may be of particular interest to an Aries.\n©iStock.com/pat138241\nAn April 11 zodiac sign may find that they are lucky in a number of careers. This is a person who has some blessings from Jupiter, after all. An Aries with this particular birthday may enjoy a number of different jobs in their lifetime, with travel and freedom featuring significantly in them. No matter what, all Aries enjoy jobs that don’t ask them to commit to a mundane task, day in, day out!\nThese Mars natives do best when they can use their boundless energies for good. An Aries may enjoy leading, particularly one with the number 2 so prevalent in their life. Business partnerships or close mentoring positions may interest someone with this birthday, though the job itself will still need to be active.\nAthletic careers or performances may be of particular interest to an Aries. Likewise, this may be a person that enjoys leading a small, dedicated group of people. Flexibility in a work schedule is important to the often-impetuous ram, as this is someone who doesn’t enjoy being told what to do on the best of days! Having the freedom to plan their days is important to an Aries.\nBesides athletic careers, Aries suns enjoy self-employed or entrepreneurial tasks. They enjoy being the only ones responsible for their wealth, status, and importance. Self-made careers may feature heavily in this person, though many varied careers are likely to fall in the lap of a third decan Aries born on April 11th!\nApril 11 Zodiac in a Relationships and Love\nAries are incredibly giving, humorous, and passionate lovers.\n©Algernon77/Shutterstock.com\nWe have mentioned the potential for obsession in an Aries, and this often manifests strongly in new romantic relationships for the ram. An Aries born on April 11th may be seeking people that embody their personal viewpoint of love. Once they find someone that ticks their boxes, this headstrong fire sign stops at nothing to get their attention and affection.\nThis pursuit will be intense, and it may scare off the average person who doesn’t understand Aries energy. An April 11th Aries enjoys winning, and their obsessive energy will mean plenty of dates, gifts, conversations, and more in the early stages of any relationship. Aries are incredibly giving, humorous, and passionate lovers, after all!\nHowever, both a positive and a negative, the average Aries isn’t afraid to move on from a relationship that they feel no longer suits them. This is an admirable quality, as many people linger in relationships that aren’t compatible. However, many Aries suns may benefit from sticking with a relationship a bit longer, though this may feel opposite to an Aries born in the Sagittarius decan!\nPotential Matches and Compatibility for April 11 Zodiac Signs\nFirst thing’s first, there’s no such thing as bad matches in the zodiac. All of us are individuals with individual wants, needs, and ways of loving each other. Plus, the rest of your birth chart greatly affects who you are compatible with in love (Venus, Mars, and Mercury placements matter in particular). However, some sun signs truly vibe better than others!\nWith an April 11th birthday in mind, here are some potential matches found in the rest of the zodiac:\nLibra . Opposites definitely attract when it comes to a Libra/Aries match. Given that they are opposites on the astrological wheel, both of these cardinal signs want the same thing, but have extremely different ways of getting there. An April 11th Aries will value a Libra’s keen mind , devotion to close relationships, and compromising nature, something that may truly benefit an Aries/Libra match in the long run!\nSagittarius . With their third decan placement, an April 11th Aries will feel uncharacteristically drawn to Sagittarians. A mutable fire sign, Sagittarians will work well with the energetic and freedom-oriented Aries. While this may not be a match that lasts forever, both of these signs will fully appreciate each other in the moment.\nPisces . The final sign of the zodiac, Pisces are technically next to Aries on the astrological wheel, a placement that signifies attraction. A mutable water sign, Pisces may not appear like a good match for Aries at first. However, their tender and flexible natures means that an April 11th Aries will always have a partner who is willing to compromise and dote on them when they need it.\nUp Next:\nSee a Gator Bite an Electric Eel With 860 Volts\nThe 15 Deepest Lakes in the United States\nWatch an Impossibly Rare Coyote and Bobcat Sighting at Once\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

This means that, as an April 21 zodiac sign, you are indeed a Taurus , right at the beginning of Taurus season! But there’s so much more to your birthday than just saying you’re a bull. Through astrology , numerology, and symbolic connections, we can learn a lot about a person.\nAnd that’s exactly what we will do in this article. We’ll take a deep dive into all things Taurus, specifically a Taurus with a birthday on April 21st. Not only will we address the potential strengths and weaknesses of this earth sign. We’ll also take a cue from symbolism and numerology to learn everything we need to know about someone with this specific birthday. Let’s get started!\nApril 21 Zodiac Sign: Taurus\nTauruses are fully grounded in the real.\n©Vadim Sadovski/Shutterstock.com\nThe second sign of the zodiac, Tauruses represent youthful stability. This is a fixed earth sign after all, a sign of deep roots, stubbornness, and dedication. As a Taurus born on April 21st, you belong to the very beginnings of Taurus season. This means that you represent the height of the Taurus personality, especially compared to other Taurus birthdays!\nBut why might this be? Well, there are additional astrological influences on our birthdays, depending on when they fall during the season of our sun sign. Given that each sign makes up 30 degrees of the astrological wheel, it’s safe to say that a variety of transits, influences, and more occur throughout a single sign. Notably, decans are to blame for why a Taurus born at the beginning of Taurus season presents slightly differently from a Taurus born at the end!\nThe Decans of Taurus\nWe can break down our sun sign’s 30-degree increments into smaller portions known as decans. These decans change roughly every nine to ten days during the season of your sun sign, which is why a May 5th Taurus will be different from an April 21st Taurus! It’s important to note that decans are secondarily ruled over by astrological signs belonging to the same element as your sun sign. Still confused? Here’s how the decans of Taurus work, day by day:\nFirst Taurus decan . From April 20th to roughly April 29th. This is considered to be the Taurus decan of Taurus, which means that people born during this period of time present as classic Tauruses ruled by the planet Venus.\nSecond Taurus decan . From April 30th to roughly May 9th. This is considered to be the Virgo decan of Taurus, which means that people born during this period of time have some Virgo personality traits and are secondarily ruled by Mercury.\nThird Taurus decan . From May 10th to roughly May 20th. This is considered to be the Capricorn decan of Taurus, which means that people born during this period of time have some Capricorn personality traits and are secondarily ruled by Saturn.\nAs an April 21st Taurus, you’re definitely a Taurus, through and through! Venus is your only planetary influence, and what an influence it has. Let’s talk more about Venus and its sway over Taurus now.\nRuling Planets of an April 21 Zodiac\nAnything rooted in reality is deeply important to a Taurus.\n©iStock.com/3quarks\nVenus rules over both Taurus and Libra, lending both of these signs different priorities and ways of expressing themselves. When it comes to Taurus, Venus lends the bull an invested interest in the sensual. This manifests in different ways, but it’s important to break down what exactly Venus represents first.\nKnown as the planet of our senses, representing love, aesthetics, art, beauty, and indulgence, Venus is a powerful personal planet. It rules over Taurus and makes this fixed earth sign interested in the arts, the beauty of our world, and how they can sensually interpret such a world. \nThis is because a Taurus loves all things physical. Anything rooted in reality is deeply important to a Taurus. While Libras might daydream and utilize their influence from Venus to explore lofty ideations and aesthetics, Tauruses are fully grounded in the real. Venus helps them see the beauty in daily life, encouraging Taurus to use their senses to fully seize the day, no matter how simple it might be.\nBecause, while Venus is a planet built on indulgence, it teaches an April 21st Taurus how to indulge in their own simple ways. This isn’t to say that Tauruses don’t indulge, often too much for their own good! But Venus asks Taurus to slow down, take in all of the wonders of the world, and learn how to appreciate it using all five senses and a trademark Taurean devotion!\nApril 21: Numerology and Other Associations\nThe average Taurus holds in them a stability and a hardworking soul that the average bull also has.\n©iStock.com/Wayne Martin\nThere’s no way to talk about Taurus without mentioning their association with the bull. This is not only represented in the Taurus constellation and symbol for Taurus, but there are some other undeniable connections on a personal level too. The average Taurus holds in them a stability and a hardworking soul that the average bull also has.\nWhile it’s a common enough thing to hear “you mess with the bull, you get the horns”, the horns of a Taurus don’t happen without a lot of provoking. The same can be said of bullfighting bulls or other oxen: they won’t mess with you unless you mess with them! A Taurus is a peaceful individual, but you will not win against them should you choose to provoke their deep-rooted ire.\nBesides some obvious bovine connections, an April 21st Taurus in particular should look to numerology. The number 3 is present in your life when we add the digits of your specific day of birth. This is a number associated with logic, positivity, and measured excitement. Jupiter rules the number 3 after all, and this is a large planet known for philosophy, optimism, and personal growth.\nThe number 3 is prevalent throughout history and in many different topics. An April 21st Taurus may benefit from this versatile number in many ways. There is a sense of methodic thinking to this number, especially when paired with a Taurus’s keen sense of time passing. Nothing about a Taurus is sporadic or spontaneous, and the number 3 helps an April 21st Taurus make measured steps to reach their goals.\nApril 21 Zodiac: Personality and Traits of a Taurus\nSteadfastness, patience, and strength are all part of the personality of an April 21st Taurus.\n©Algernon77/Shutterstock.com\nTo fully understand a Taurus, we need to take a closer look at a few different things. It’s important to address the fixed modality of a Taurus first. This is a sign that thrives in stability, whatever that might look like to them. Their fixed natures make them incredible when it comes to commitment and routine, though this is definitely a sign known for its stubbornness.\nLikewise, Tauruses are represented by the element of earth. A Taurus is the richest, most luxurious earth sign thanks to Venus. Hardworking, practical, and nurturing, earth signs inherently enjoy growth and watching people in their lives grow. A Taurus is steadfast, with two feet planted firmly in the soil that they love.\nSteadfastness, patience, and strength are all part of the personality of an April 21st Taurus. This is someone who works hard and still knows how to enjoy the luxuries of life without fear of judgment. Given that Taurus is the second sign of the zodiac, they represent youth, often associated with toddler-aged kids.\nBecause this age group is absolutely obsessed with using their senses to interpret the world around them. A Taurus born on April 21st knows how to enact their ambitious goals while still finding time to appreciate their life using all 5 senses. Physical things are extremely important to Tauruses and, much like toddlers, you should strive to never take physical things from a Taurus lest you invoke a tantrum!\nStrengths and Weaknesses of Taurus\nStubbornness is of course a weakness of Taurus.\n©Tanya Antusenok/Shutterstock.com\nIt’s no secret that a Taurus is patient and giving. Despite being associated with youth, this isn’t a necessarily selfish sign. In fact, Tauruses are incredibly committed and loyal friends, partners, and family members. In many ways, this is their primary strength and weakness: the staying power of an April 21st Taurus makes them reliable but it also might mean they hang onto things for far longer than they should.\nThis is why many people perceive Tauruses as lazy. This is of course an unfair assumption, especially when you consider the work ethic of the average bull. However, a Taurus’s inability to change manifests in all aspects of their personality, from relationships to careers to opinions. Should you engage in a confrontation with a Taurus , don’t ever expect to sway them on their thoughts or long-held opinions!\nStubbornness is of course a weakness of Taurus, especially when you take their fixed modality into account. This is a sign that knows what they’re about, for better or worse. A Taurus will ask you to love them as they are or find someone else, as they aren’t interested in changing! However, in return, a Taurus offers those in their life an endless fascination with luxury and details as well as a steadfast friend.\nCareer Choices for an April 21 Zodiac\nCulinary careers are natural routes for a Taurus to take.\n©iStock.com/gorodenkoff\nA Taurus born on April 21st may find themselves attracted to a number of careers. All earth signs tend to have a strong work ethic, something that becomes part of their personality. This is especially true of Tauruses, given just how long they tend to stay in one job. However, a Taurus will thrive if they have a job that allows them to clock out so that they can enjoy what truly matters to them in life!\nA Taurus born on April 21st will shine in just about any career, though they won’t seek the spotlight. Using their step-by-step attitude thanks to the number 3, an April 21st Taurus will regularly hit deadlines, make steady progress, and even inspire those around them to work with a similar dedication.\nIt’s important for a Taurus to have some way of incorporating their senses into their career. This can manifest in many ways, from using their hands to playing music. The arts and music in particular tend to excite Tauruses, though culinary careers are also natural routes for a Taurus to take. Greenery and new life also matter to this youthful, springtime season sign, so working with plants or young children may benefit a bull born on April 21st!\nApril 21 Zodiac in a Relationships and Love\nOnce a Taurus has chosen someone they want to commit to, they don’t waste time.\n©Golden Dayz/Shutterstock.com\nTauruses are a wonderful sign to fall in love with, even if the courting part of this romance may take a while. While incredibly discerning when it comes to love (Tauruses typically have a lot of friends thanks to Venus and their ability to have a good time!), Tauruses tend to take their time . They enjoy being thorough and measured, especially a Taurus associated with the number 3!\nThis is definitely a sign that benefits from someone else making the first move. However, it’s also important to remember just how set in their ways a Taurus can be. This isn’t a person that is going to be up for doing anything outside of their wheelhouse. Many Tauruses struggle in the early stages of a relationship given that their commitment is where they truly shine.\nOnce a Taurus has chosen someone they want to commit to, they don’t waste time. Like the previous sign before them, Aries , Taurus dislikes waste when it comes to settling down. They are built on a strong foundation and they want to share this permanence with someone special, as soon as they possibly can!\nWhile this committed heart is a beautiful thing, an April 21st Taurus should watch out for partners that may not be as invested as they are. It’s easy for a Taurus to get taken advantage of in love, especially because they want to indulge the person that they’re with. This is a quick way for a Taurus to run out of money, patience, and compassion should they be partnered with someone who doesn’t value them for who they truly are!\nPotential Matches and Compatibility for April 21 Zodiac Signs\nIt’s easy for a Taurus to get taken advantage of in love.\n©iStock.com/Svetlana Soloveva\nEarth signs can be tricky in relationships with fire signs, given their propensity to get burned. Water signs nourish their more emotional sides, something that most earth signs very much need. While air signs intrigue most earth signs with their intelligence and ideas, there is a flighty and lofty nature to most air signs that likely won’t appeal to a Taurus.\nHowever, there are truly no incompatible matches in the zodiac as we are all individuals with complicated needs and birth charts! On paper and in traditional astrology, here are some compatible matches when paired with a Taurus born on April 21st:\nVirgo . A fellow earth sign, Virgos adore a Taurus’s commitment to the simple beauty of everyday life. Virgos are of a mutable modality, which means that they’ll likely adapt well to a fixed sign like Taurus. Plus, Virgos are natural caretakers of the zodiac and understand how to protect an April 21 zodiac sign from overextending themselves.\nScorpio . The shared fixed nature of Scorpio and Taurus is often where they run into the most trouble. However, Scorpios are opposite Taurus on the astrological wheel, which means they have the same goals but different means of reaching said goals. Scorpios will be devoted to Tauruses and help them connect to their emotional realms, though both of these signs will need to learn how to compromise eventually!\nPisces . Another mutable sign like Virgo but a water sign like Scorpio, Pisces are the psychic caretakers of the zodiac. They are highly creative and wise, something that will entice a Taurus. Plus, Pisces know what a Taurus needs both emotionally and on a daily basis, which may help nourish this hardworking bull!\nUp Next:\nSee a Gator Bite an Electric Eel With 860 Volts\nThe 15 Deepest Lakes in the United States\nWatch an Impossibly Rare Coyote and Bobcat Sighting at Once\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

The fact of the matter is that there is no such thing as a canine breed that is 100 percent hypoallergenic. There are some breeds, however, that are said to cause minimal allergies in those that are particularly sensitive to dog dander.\nDespite their widespread popularity, Boston Terriers are not the best choice for people who suffer from dog allergies. Keep reading to understand why and learn tips on minimizing potential allergy triggers if you are sensitive to dog dander.\nWhat Does “Hypoallergenic” Mean?\nBoston terriers shed minimally.\n©Zakharova_Elena/Shutterstock.com\nTo have minimal or no effect on allergy sufferers, a dog must be hypoallergenic. A hypoallergenic dog would have non-shedding fur. This means no dander will be floating around in the air from your pet’s skin because the hair won’t fall off. It turns out that canine allergies aren’t nearly as common as you may imagine. People who are allergic to pets are often hypersensitive to the dander shed by the animals .\nSo, Are Boston Terriers Hypoallergenic?\nUnfortunately, no; Boston Terriers are not hypoallergenic. Although they shed minimally due to their short coats, they are commonly reported to worsen allergy symptoms in some people with known dog allergies. For some tips on minimizing allergy symptoms, keep reading!\nHow To Minimize Allergies Caused by Your Boston Terriers\nIf you recently got a Boston Terrier and have allergies, you can limit allergens in your dog and environment.\n©Zero Degrees Photography/Shutterstock.com\nSteps can be taken to reduce allergens in your dog and the environment if you have recently adopted a Boston Terrier and are experiencing allergy difficulties. You can help lessen the allergic problems you suffer with Boston Terriers by following these steps:\nCanine Care\nA dog’s coat needs to be brushed on a regular basis to keep it clean and healthy. If you or a member of your family suffers from dog allergies, it’s best to have someone else do the grooming.\nYou should bathe your dog at least twice a month. Select a shampoo that will help prevent further hair loss and a wash that will not irritate their skin.\nTake your Boston Terrier outside for exercise, petting, and playfulness.\nHousehold Tips\nIf you suffer from allergies, washing your hands frequently is recommended, especially after handling your dog.\nRegular cleaning, including weekly laundry, daily dusting, and weekly vacuuming, can help reduce dog dander.\nTo avoid re-spreading allergies in your house, avoid “dry cleaning” with dusters and brooms. To eliminate airborne allergens, wipe down surfaces with damp towels or use a static-charged cleaner, such as a Swiffer.\nIf you have severe allergies, you should consider enforcing a no-dogs policy in your bedroom.\nThe Humane Society suggests a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaner for allergy sufferers. Filters should be changed on a regular basis.\nReplace your carpet with hardwood flooring. Carpets are notorious for collecting and harboring allergies.\nDoes Consistent Grooming Help With Allergies?\nRegular trips to the groomer are necessary for all breeds, including Boston Terriers. You’ll be less likely to get an allergic reaction if you do this. Instead of taking their pets to a professional groomer, some families choose to do it themselves.\nDog fur contains allergens besides dead skin particles. Your dog’s saliva and/or urine may also be a source of allergies. The good news is that the likelihood that your Boston Terrier will cause allergies in your family is very low regardless of the length or texture of the dog’s hair.\nYou May Want to Talk to an Allergist\nBoston terrier at vet\n©iStock.com/Ridofranz\nA visit to an allergist may be your last resort if other treatments have failed. Your Boston Terrier is worthy of your undivided attention and affection. An allergist can help you continue caring for your dog in two ways: 1) by determining what triggers your allergies, and 2) by developing a treatment plan that is tailored to your unique needs.\nIt’s possible that your home has allergens besides your Boston Terriers. If you knew what was triggering your allergy, you might avoid several potential triggers, including pet dander. It’s possible that you’ll feel much better once the allergens in your home have been eliminated. An allergist can prescribe medication to alleviate your symptoms.\nShould You Have Boston Terriers If You Have Allergies?\nPopular as they may be, Boston terriers aren’t the best choice for allergy sufferers. Boston Terriers are not hypoallergenic despite the fact that their short, smooth coats may appeal to people with allergies. Boston Terriers may still trigger allergic reactions in people who are hypersensitive to dog hair and other allergens.\nUp Next:\nStaffordshire Bull Terrier vs Pitbull: What are the Differences?\nDogs With The Highest Bite Force\nTop 10 Cheapest Dogs\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

You will also learn about the botanical gardens, arboretums, and plant nurseries in North Dakota where you can see bamboo growing for yourself!\nThough it is native to Asia, today, bamboo plants grow across the world in many different climates and soil conditions.\n©Phuwadon Phichairat/Shutterstock.com\nChallenges of Growing Bamboo in North Dakota\nAlthough North Dakota’s climate does have extremely cold winters, this state also experiences wide variations in temperature over the year. North Dakota is a state in the northern part of the Great Plains region. There, the winter temperatures regularly drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The winters are also often very windy, which contributes to a wind chill that makes the temperature feel even colder. However, summers can be warm, pleasant, sunny, and dry. \nThis may sound like an inhospitable environment in which to grow bamboo, a plant that typically thrives in moist areas with sun and warm temperatures. However, bamboo plants are extremely resilient and can adapt well to many different climates. Though it is native to Asia, today, bamboo plants grow across the world in many different climates and soil conditions. This includes bamboo that grows throughout the diverse geography and climates within the United States. \nYou may find that growing bamboo in North Dakota is a challenge, but one you can overcome with enough water, well-draining soil, fertilizer, protection from the harshest winter elements, and a cold-hardy species of bamboo.\nThe most resilient, cold-hardy bamboo species that can grow in North Dakota include species such as Moso bamboo.\n©iStock.com/weisschr\nBamboo Species to Grow in North Dakota\nThe most resilient, cold-hardy bamboo species that can grow in North Dakota include species such as Moso bamboo ( Phyllostachys edulis) , black bamboo ( Phyllostachys nigra ), golden bamboo ( Phyllostachys aurea) , arrow bamboo ( Pseudosas japonica ). Many of these species are known for being good choices to grow throughout the United States’ most northernmost regions, and in areas with extremely cold weather. In general, quite a few species in the Fargesia genus, known as “Fargesias,” are known to be cold-hardy. The group of plants in the Phyllostachys genus, which includes several species named above, are also quite cold-hardy. \nAccording to some plant experts, the variation  Phyllostachys manii  ‘Decora,’ also known as “Beautiful Bamboo,” may be a good choice for growing bamboo in North Dakota. This variation has colorful colorings on its stalks that create a rainbow effect.\nAdditionally, the cold-hardy bamboo plant,  Fargesia rufa , is a popular choice for growing in colder climates such as in North Dakota.\nThe cold-hardy bamboo plant, Fargesia rufa, is a popular choice for growing in colder climates such as North Dakota.\n©silentstock639/Shutterstock.com\nBenefits of Growing Bamboo in North Dakota\nDespite these challenges, you may also find some benefits to growing bamboo in North Dakota.  First, the dense root systems of bamboo can help to prevent soil erosion. Second, the tall, thick bamboo clusters can help provide natural shade and protect from strong winds. These thick groups of bamboo can also provide attractive, natural privacy screens. Third, bamboo can be a useful sustainable resource used for a wide array of projects. As a material in producing furniture, homes, textiles, and more, bamboo is a great sustainable alternative to other materials that have a detrimental environmental impact. \nHowever, you must weigh these benefits along with the potential drawbacks of bamboo. In general, keep in mind the risk that this potentially-invasive species poses for local ecosystems.\nBamboo is originally from Asia and is a type of grass that comes in over 1,000 (and potentially as many as 2,000) species.\n©Peter Turner Photography/Shutterstock.com\nAbout Bamboo\nBamboo is originally from Asia and is a type of grass that comes in over 1,000 (and potentially as many as 2,000) species. These belong to over 100 genera in the Poaceae family and the Bambusoideae subfamily. These many different species vary greatly in size, appearance, growing habits, and resilience to harsh climates. Because of this, different bamboo species grow in a broad range of ecosystems around the world, across continents. Bamboo can grow to great heights, with thick stalks that give the plants a tree-like appearance.\nBamboo has a long, rich history going back thousands of years. Because it is originally from Asia, bamboo has a long history in China . There, it has long been used for medicinal, culinary, and building purposes. Bamboo spread from China to other parts of Asia, including Japan and Southeast Asian countries. There, it became a vital part of local culture. Bamboo came to the West, including the United States, during the 1700s. Since then, bamboo has been a very popular ornamental plant and has begun rising in popularity as a renewable natural resource for construction, textiles, furniture, and food. Bamboo also grows throughout the United States as a landscaping feature.\nOverall, bamboo has a long, rich, and interesting history. Its versatility and adaptability make it an important resource around the world. However, not everywhere is suitable for growing bamboo. Because bamboo does not grow natively in North Dakota, it can spread and become an invasive species threatening the native ecosystem. With that in mind, monitor your bamboo plants and manage their spread so that they do not take over your landscape. \nTo see bamboo growing in North Dakota, consider visiting a botanical garden, arboretum, plant nursery, or conservatory.\n©szefei/Shutterstock.com\nBamboo Arboretums and Gardens in North Dakota\nTo see bamboo growing in North Dakota, consider visiting a botanical garden, arboretum, plant nursery, or conservatory.

With their tuxedo-like appearance, waddling walk, and charming personalities, it’s no wonder they’ve captured the hearts of people around the world. And what better way to see these beloved creatures up close than by visiting incredible aquariums and zoos with penguins?\nLuckily for penguin enthusiasts, there are several such locations throughout the United States . Each of these incredible aquariums and zoos offers a unique and unforgettable experience where visitors can learn about the different penguin species, their behavior, and their natural habitats. Whether you’re an animal lover, a family with children, or simply seeking a fun and educational outing, a visit to one of these penguin havens is a must.\nPenguins\nPenguins are known for their social behavior and often live in large colonies. They are also well adapted to living in harsh environments, with a layer of fat under their skin and a dense layer of feathers that help keep them warm. In addition, their streamlined bodies make them excellent swimmers, and they use their wings to “fly” through the water.\nWhen it comes to eating, penguins are primarily carnivores and feed on fish, krill, and squid. They are excellent divers. One of their species, known as Gentoo , can swim up to 22 miles per hour.\nOne fascinating fact about penguins is the presence of a gland located near their eyes. This gland filters out the surplus salt from the bloodstream. Therefore, the glands enable them to consume seawater without adverse effects.\nOnce annually, penguins undergo what’s known as a catastrophic molt, in which they lose all of their feathers at once. While most birds shed feathers throughout the year, penguins lose them all in one go. This molting process can last between 2 to 3 weeks, during which time they are unable to swim or fish. Therefore, penguins consume an ample amount of food to fatten themselves up beforehand to survive this period.\nPenguins live in large colonies and can “fly” through the ocean water up to 22 mph.\n©vladsilver/Shutterstock.com\nEvolution Of Penguins\nAccording to scientific research, penguins have a shared ancestry with a group of seabirds that includes petrels and albatrosses . It is believed that penguins evolved the ability to dive early in their evolution, much like the puffin . As they adapted to their aquatic environment, they became exceptional swimmers and divers. Therefore, they lost their ability to fly.\nThrough a recent study, it was demonstrated that changes in global temperature, including fluctuations between cold and warm periods, and the movements of major ocean currents have significantly influenced the evolution of penguins.\nThe first recorded penguin, Waimanu manneringi , was discovered in New Zealand . This penguin dated back 61 million years. This was approximately 5 million years after the mass extinction of the dinosaurs.\nHistorically, penguins were significantly larger than the species we see today. For instance, the Kumimanu biceae , which resided in New Zealand approximately 55 to 60 million years ago, stood at an impressive height of around 5 ft 8 inches. Comparatively, the largest existing species, the emperor penguin , is approximately 4 feet and 3 inches tall.\nCurrently, there are 17 to 20 penguin species in existence, and they can all be found in the southern hemisphere. However, the Galapagos penguin ( Spheniscus mendiculus ) is the sole penguin species that can be found north of the equator.\nAquariums and Zoos with Penguins\nLet’s dive straight into discussing the zoos and aquariums that house these amazing creatures.\nWoodland Park Zoo – Washington\nWoodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington , is recognized nationally as one of the leading zoos in the country to observe penguins.

Each zone features diverse natural habitats such as humid tropical rainforests, coastal deserts, and temperate rainforests like those found in the Pacific Northwest.\nWhen the Woodland Park Zoo first welcomed 20 Humboldt penguins , they created an exciting new habitat in their 32,000-gallon pool. The pool is temperature-controlled by geothermal wells and filtered through a sand filter that uses natural wetlands to treat the backwash. Additionally, the pool is periodically replenished with collected rainwater, creating a sustainable and eco-friendly environment for the penguins.\nThe penguin exhibit can accommodate up to 60 penguins at a time. Therefore, it is a great place to see and learn about these fascinating birds.\nOriginating from the hot, arid coastal regions of Peru, the Humboldt penguins can be observed both above and below water at certain exhibits. These exhibits are designed to replicate the shores of the Punta San Juan Reserve in Peru, which is a wildlife sanctuary. Therefore, visitors can experience the penguins in a setting as close to their natural habitat as possible.\nCome and visit the penguin at the zoo any day from 9:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., and experience these amazing creatures up close!\nWoodland Park Zoo is recognized as one of the leading zoos in the country to observe penguins.\n©Chang Han Chris Kim/Shutterstock.com\nMonterey Bay Aquarium – California\nIt’s no wonder that the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, California , is renowned as one of the best aquariums in the United States, given its impressive collection of aquatic life.

Many zoos and aquariums rescue and rehabilitate wild animals, but not all animals can be safely released back into the wild. Dolphins are amazing creatures, often found in aquariums and zoos. These large aquatic mammals are intelligent and playful. However, dolphins living in captivity are different than those in the wild.\nCurrently, over 3,000 dolphins are living full-time in aquariums. There are also at least 40 types of dolphins throughout the world. While you can take your chance and book a dolphin tour in the ocean, there’s no guarantee you will see one in its natural environment. However, if you’d like to see a dolphin, one of your best chances of visiting a zoo or aquarium.\nListed below are 10 aquariums and zoos with dolphins.\nGeorgia Aquarium\nThe Georgia Aquarium is a sprawling aquarium with dolphins.\n©Connor.carey / Creative Commons / Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled GNU Free Documentation License. – License\nThe first aquarium on our list to house dolphins is the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, Georgia . This aquarium was previously the largest in the world. While it’s no longer the largest in the world, the Georgia Aquarium is the largest in the United States. One of the most popular things to do in the Georgia Aquarium is the dolphin animal encounter. You can meet the trainers and interact directly with the dolphins during this encounter. You can still see common bottlenose dolphins if you don’t want to pay extra. The Georgia Aquarium has other great animals, including a large and majestic whale shark . You also don’t have to leave the comfort of your home to see the facility’s animals, as the Georgia Aquarium broadcasts some of its animal tanks live.\nTexas State Aquarium\nTexas State Aquarium is located in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n©Philip Lange/Shutterstock.com\nYou can also find dolphins in the Texas State Aquarium in Corpus Christi, Texas . The aquarium covers about 6 acres and first opened on July 6, 1990. One of the most popular exhibits in this aquarium is Dolphin Bay. Here guests can interact and admire Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. The 400,000-gallon, 12-foot-deep saltwater pool offers two main viewing points. The dolphins in the aquarium are able for release back into the wild. Shadow is the oldest dolphin and was born on July 23, 1992. He was born with a small hole in his dorsal fin. Another dolphin in this aquarium is Merlin, the youngest dolphin known for his pink belly. Trainers love working with Schooner, born in 2007, as he is likely the smartest dolphin in the tank.\nThe Indianapolis Zoo\nDolphins, penguins, and tigers are some of the animals you can see at the Indianapolis Zoo.\n©Lefteris Papaulakis/Shutterstock.com\nThe Indianapolis Zoo in Indianapolis, Indiana , is a large zoo featuring dolphins. This zoo is a favorite for many locals and opened its doors on April 18, 1964. The zoo covers about 64 acres and contains 1,416 different animal species. Nearly 1.5 million people every year visit the Indianapolis Zoo. Apart from a zoo, it’s also an aquarium and a botanical garden. While visiting, you can see penguins , tigers, macaws , and grey seals. In the Oceans exhibit, you can meet the local dolphins. You can also attend a dolphin presentation if you want to learn more. Calypso is a bottlenose dolphin in the zoo. She’s nicknamed “the big sister” and has a dark area under her chin. Calypso sometimes swims with her tongue out. Born in 2011, Hemmingway came to the Indianapolis Zoo from Marineland Aquarium in Florida. He is considered a drama starter and has pointed-tail flukes.\nShedd Aquarium\nThe Shedd Aquarium has a tank with over 2 million gallons of water inside\n©Ken Lund / flickr – License\nOne of the oldest aquariums in the United States is Shedd Aquarium, which first opened on May 30, 1930. It’s located in Chicago, Illinois , and covers 10 acres. There are many exciting exhibits and animals to see, including Pacific white-sided dolphins. You can see these unique dolphins in the Abbott Oceanarium and Polar Play Zone. These playful dolphins are fast swimmers, reaching speeds up to 25 mph. Within Shedd Aquarium, there is a pod of 5 Pacific white-sided dolphins. The oldest is Kri. She’s also one of the largest dolphins in the pod, measuring 6 feet and 5 inches long. She first came to Shedd Aquarium in 1991 when she was 6 years old. Harmony is the newest addition, born on August 31, 2020. She is playful and young and was named by fourth-grader classrooms in Chicago Public Schools.\nMiami Seaquarium\nThe Miami Seaquarium opened in 1955.\n©Helen89/Shutterstock.com\nThe next aquarium home to dolphins is the Miami Seaquarium. While the Miami Seaquarium is not the largest aquarium in the United States, it still has many exhibits and animals. Miami Seaquarium opened on September 24, 1955. It covers about 38 acres. Here you can not only find dolphins but also manatees and stingrays. Miami Seaquarium also offers close tours and dolphin swims. However, you don’t have to purchase extras to see bottlenose dolphins in their tank. You can also experience dolphin shows, like Top Deck Dolphin and the Flipper Dolphin Show.\nAsamushi Aquarium\nAnother aquarium that hosts dolphins is the Asamushi Aquarium in Aomori Prefecture, Japan . It overlooks Mutsu Bay and covers about 12 acres of land. The largest tank’s volume is 82,000 U.S. gallons, the dolphin exhibition pool. The doors to Asamushi Aquarium opened to the public in 1922, but the aquarium was rebuilt in 1983. This aquarium has over 400 species of animals and 10,000 animals in total. Apart from viewing the dolphins in the tank, you can also experience a dynamic dolphin show where the animals perform tricks with trainers.\nMississippi Aquarium\nNext, we have the Mississippi Aquarium in Gulfport, Mississippi . It’s a relatively new aquarium and opened on August 29, 2020. It covers about 5.8 acres and includes indoor and outdoor exhibitions. Aside from seeing many incredible animals in the Mississippi Aquarium, you can also book unique tours to get up, close, and personal with them. Dolphin Encounter is a popular animal encounter. You get to meet and interact with a dolphin for 5 minutes with a trainer. There are four Atlantic bottlenose dolphins seen from a multi-viewing tank. Axl is the oldest and largest dolphin at 8.5 feet long and 400 pounds. He’s a playful dolphin and sometimes swims upside down. Finn, however, is the smallest dolphin in the pod and weighs 340 pounds. He’s silly and loves interacting with people, often sticking out his tongue.\nMundo Marino\nMundo Marino opened on January 6, 1979, and is home to over 9,000 animals. It’s the largest aquarium in Argentina . Not only are there animal exhibits and shows, but also fun-filled rides. One of the main attractions in this large aquarium is the “Refugio del Mar”, which has many bottlenose dolphins. The history of this park is interesting. After visiting the United States and leaving impressed with the aquariums, Juan David Méndez purchased land in San Clemente del Tuyú. He opened the park intending to help sick and dying marine animals get better and releases them back into the ocean.\nRodadero Sea Aquarium and Museum\nThe Rodadero Sea Aquarium and Museum is a beautiful Santa Marta, Colombia aquarium. Captain Francisco Ospina Navia opened this stunning aquarium and museum in 1965. The place is accessible by motor boat. This unique aquarium contains 13 pools directly connected to the Caribbean Sea. Nearly 95% of the Rodadero Sea Aquarium and Museum animals are native to the region. There are at least 805 animals, including sea turtles and seabirds. Many of the exhibits are centered around dolphins, and there is a popular dolphin show.\nThe National Aquarium in Baltimore\nLocated in Baltinore’s Inner Harbor, the National Aquarium features thousands of animals, including dolphins.\n©ESB Professional/Shutterstock.com\nThe National Aquarium in Baltimore is located in downtown Baltimore, Maryland .

While butterflies come in many colors, yellow and black seem quite common.\nColorations can vary in the same butterfly species. Therefore, not all the butterflies listed below are black and yellow all the time.\nHere is a list of the yellow and black butterfly species commonly found in North America.\n1. Tiger Swallowtail\nThe female tiger swallowtail has four black stripes on its forewings with some blue displayed on its hindwing.\n©Maria T Hoffman/Shutterstock.com\nThe tiger swallowtail is found throughout much of North America. You can find it from the eastern parts of the United States to eastern Canada. It’s one of the largest species of swallowtail butterflies, with its wingspan reaching up to 4.5 inches.\nThe underside of the male’s wings is yellow, but they have four black stripes on each forewing – hence their name. The females have a similar pattern but have some blue on their hindwing and larger tiger stripes.\nThese butterflies are found in several habitats, including woodlands and suburban gardens. They consume nectar from flowers, rotting fruit, sap, and dung.\nWhen threatened, they release a chemical from their glands to deter predators. However, this chemical is completely harmless to humans.\n2. Eastern Black Swallowtail\nThe eastern black swallowtail butterfly has mostly black with yellow markings on the upper side of its wings.\n©Sari ONeal/Shutterstock.com\nThe eastern black swallowtail is native to North America. They’re most commonly found in eastern parts of the United States but also as far North as Canada or as far South as Mexico. This butterfly is one of the world’s largest and most striking butterflies.\nTheir wingspan can range from 2.7 to 4 inches. The upper side of their wing is mostly black with yellow markings, while the underside is black with white and orange markings. The females have similar patterns, but they have more blue and are often larger.\nThis butterfly can live in many habitats, such as meadows and gardens. They mostly consume nectar from flowers, but the caterpillars consume the leaves of several different plants. They particularly like species of the carrot family, including parsley, dill, and fennel.\nThe eastern black swallowtail also produces a foul-smelling chemically that deters predators. However, this chemical isn’t dangerous to predators or humans.\n3. Clouded Sulphur\nThe clouded sulfur butterfly is yellow with orange and black markings near their wingtips.\n©Steve Byland/Shutterstock.com\nThe clouded sulphur is an interesting butterfly found throughout much of North America, including Alaska and Mexico. They’re a member of the family Pieridae, which includes many different yellow butterflies.\nThis butterfly has a wingspan of 1.5 to 2.5 inches. The upper side of their wings is yellow, and they have orange and black markings near their wingtips. The underside is paler, but it has a similar appearance.\nYou can find them in various environments, including meadows, gardens, and fields. They consume mostly nectar from flowers. The caterpillars feed on the leaves of several different plants, but their favorites are members of the pea family.\nThis species is migratory. They move northward in the spring and southward in the fall. They overwinter in warmer southern regions.\n4. Orange Sulphur\nThe orange sulphur butterfly has bright orange upper wings with black markings near its wingtips and yellow markings on its underside.\n©iStock.com/McKinneMike\nThe orange sulphur butterfly is also native to much of North America. They’re found in the western United States and southern Canada. They’re another member of the family Pieridae, which we’ve discussed several times in this article.\nTheir wingspan ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 inches. The upper side of their wings is bright orange with black markings near their wingtips. The underside is similar, but it is very pale with yellow markings.\nLike other butterflies, they are found in many habitats, including meadows and gardens. They consume mostly nectar, while the caterpillars consume leaves from many plants. Their favorites are clover, alfalfa, and another pea family member.\nThey migrate, moving as the weather changes.\n5. American Lady\nThe American lady butterfly is mostly orange and black though they can appear yellow in lighter colorations.\n©samray/Shutterstock.com\nThe American lady is more orange than yellow. However, they can appear yellow in lighter colorations. They’re native to North America and found from Canada to Mexico. They’re about as large as the other butterflies, measuring 1.75 to 2.5 inches.\nTheir wings are mostly orange and black, though they have white spots near the tips of their wings. The underside of their wings are grayish-brown, which helps them camouflage.\nThe American lady lives in most habitats, including meadows, fields, and gardens. Like most butterflies, they consume nectar as adults. Caterpillars consume the leaves of several different plants, but they prefer aster family members, including sunflowers.\nLike many butterflies, the American lady is threatened due to habitat loss and pesticides. There are several conservation efforts to help protect them and other species, though.\n6. Painted Lady\nPainted lady butterflies are a highly migratory species, with some butterflies traveling across whole continents.\n©iStock.com/leekris\nThe Painted lady is found worldwide, including in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa . They’re a highly migratory species, with some butterflies traveling across whole continents. This behavior is likely why they are found throughout much of the world.\nTheir wingspan can reach up to 2.5 inches – about as large as other butterflies on this list. The upper side of their wings is mostly black and orange. The underside of their wings are grayish-brown with eye-like spots, which helps them camouflage.\nThey’re a generalist species, allowing them to live just about anywhere. They prefer open habitats with plenty of food, like fields, meadows, and gardens. They consume nectar from flowers, but the caterpillars feed on the leaves of just about any plant.\nThis butterfly is an important pollinator, functioning as a food source for several other birds and animals. Pesticides and a reduction in native flowers threaten them.\n7. Variegated Fritillary\nThe variegated fritillary butterfly is commonly found in fields, meadows, and woodlands within North and South America.\n©iStock.com/McKinneMike\nThis species of butterfly is related to the previous one. It’s found throughout North and South America. It’s larger than most, with its wingspan reaching up to 3 inches. The upper sides of their wings are orange and black with white spots near their wingtips. The bottom of their wings is brownish-gray.\nYou can commonly find them in fields, meadows, and woodlands. The adults eat the nectar of many different flowers, but the caterpillars feed on the leaves of several different plants. They prefer members of the violet family, though.\nThey don’t migrate, but populations may shift slightly as host plants change. The female lays her eggs exclusively on host plants, and the caterpillars feed on these until they become adults.\n8. Zebra Longwing\nThe zebra longwing butterfly lives much longer than most other butterflies, with some living as long as six months.\n©Julee75/Shutterstock.com\nThe Zebra longwing is a rather interesting butterfly. It’s native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico, Central America , and South America. They’re a brush-footed butterfly.\nThey have a distinctive appearance with long, narrow wings that are mostly black with white stripes. Their wingspan can range from 2.5 to 3.5 inches. They also have bright yellow markings on their head and thorax, which is how they ended up on this list.\nIt feeds on both nectar and pollen, unlike most butterflies. Their proboscis is long and narrow, allowing them to consume the nectar deep inside flowers. They need to feed on pollen, which provides essential nutrients.\nThey live much longer than most other butterflies, with some living as long as six months. Their longer lifespan is due to their unique diet. They can consume and live on the essential nutrients from the pollen they consume.\nThey are considered important pollinators, and their larvae serve food for several animals.\n9. Common Checkered Skipper\nThe common checkered skipper butterfly has a distinctive checkerboard pattern.\n©vagabond54/Shutterstock.com\nThe common checkered skipper is small and found throughout much of North America. They belong to the same family as other skippers.\nThey have a small wingspan of only 1 to 1.5 inches. Their bodies are covered in a distinctive black and white checkered pattern, hence their name. They can sometimes appear yellowish, so we included them on this list.\nLike most butterflies, they’re commonly found on prairies, open fields, and meadows. They consume nectar from many flowers, including clovers, asters, and thistles. That said, the larvae mostly consume the leaves of the pea family.\nThis butterfly makes fast, darting patterns, allowing them to quickly evade predators. Despite their smaller size, they’re extremely strong fliers that can travel long distances.\nThe common checkered skipper is also sometimes used as a model organism in scientific research. It is relatively easy to rear in the laboratory and has a wide range of ecological and evolutionary questions that can be investigated using this species.\nAdditionally, the butterfly has unique behavior patterns, such as its fast flight and ability to evade predators, that have been the focus of numerous animal behavior and ecology studies.\n10. Cloudless Sulphur\nThe cloudless sulphur butterfly is bright yellow with black veins and dots throughout its wings.\n©iStock.com/Chase D’animulls\nThe cloudless sulphur is a large species of butterfly found throughout the southern United States and Argentina. Their wingspan ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 inches. The upper surface of their wings is bright yellow, as is the underside. They also have a network of black veins visible on the underside of their wings and a few small black dots.\nThey prefer the same habitats as other butterflies, including meadows, fields, and gardens. The adults consume the nectar of many different flowers, such as milkweed and Lantana . Their caterpillars feed on the leaves of legume plants.\nThis butterfly is a strong flier and is known for their migration patterns. They’re known for overwintering in the ground of South Florida in the spring before flying further south in the fall. They may appear in large numbers during periods of migration.\n11. Two-barred Flasher\nThe two-barred flasher butterfly gets its name from the two bars that run across its wings.\n©Danita Delimont/Shutterstock.com\nThe two-barred flasher is a small to medium sized butterfly belonging to the same family as other skippers. They’re found throughout the southern parts of the United States, including Mexico, Central America, and South America.\nThey get their name due to the two bars that run across their wings, which stand out against the black background. Their wingspan varies from 1.5 to 2 inches, and they have a rather stocky body.\nLike all skippers, they’re known for their fast, erratic fights. They move quickly from flower to flower as they feed on nectar. Their larva consumes leaves of plants in the family Poaceae, which includes sugarcane and Bermuda grass .\nThey aren’t considered endangered, but their populations are threatened by habitat loss and pesticide use.\nThese butterflies commonly exhibit a behavior known as “puddling,” where they gather in groups on soil or sand to absorb moisture. This behavior is thought to increase their chances of finding mates, as it enhances attractiveness.\n12. Giant Swallowtail\nThe giant swallowtail is one of the largest butterflies in North America, with a wingspan that can reach up to 6 inches.\n©Kevin Collison/Shutterstock.com\nAs the name suggests, the giant swallowtail is a large butterfly found throughout much of North America . They belong to the swallowtail family , as you might expect from their name.\nThey’re one of the largest butterflies in North America, with a wingspan that can reach up to 6 inches. The upper surface of their wings is dark brown with yellow markings. The undersides are lighter with orange markings. They have a distinctive tail-like projection at the bottom, which is why they are called swallowtails.\nThey’re often founded in wooded areas, unlike other butterflies. However, they may also be found in fields and gardens. They feed on various flowers, including thistles, asters, and milkweed. Their caterpillars feed almost exclusively on the leaves of citrus trees.\nThey’re known for their graceful, slow flight patterns. They can mimic the flight of a bird and are sometimes mistaken for them, which may help them deter predators. Like birds, they can also evade predators by flying in a zigzag pattern.\nGiant swallowtails have been particularly studied for their reproductive behavior. They often lay their eggs on the leaves of citrus trees, where caterpillars can feed and grow. The caterpillars also have a unique defense mechanism involving retractable orange horns that they use to scare away predators.\n13. Black Swallowtail\nThe black swallowtail butterfly has a distinctive row of yellow spots on the upper surface of its wings.\n©Melody Mellinger/Shutterstock.com\nThe black swallowtail is a butterfly species found from southern Canada to Mexico. It is related to the previous butterfly, as you might expect.\nThis butterfly has a wingspan of 2.5 to 4 inches. The upper surface of their wings is black with a distinctive row of yellow spots. They also have a band of blue dots on the edge of their wings. The underside of the wings is lighter but has very similar patterns.\nYou can commonly find them in fields and meadows, but they may also hang around woodlands and forests. The adult butterflies feed on the nectar of flowers, including thistles, coneflowers, and milkweed. The caterpillars feed almost exclusively on the plant family Apiaceae, which includes parsley, dill, and fennel.\nThey have very graceful flight patterns, which involve slow, swooping movements. They often move from flower to flower as they feed.\n14. Pipevine Swallowtail\nThe underside of the pipevine swallowtail features white, yellow, and orange markings.\n©Danita Delimont/Shutterstock.com\nThe pipevine swallowtail also has black and yellow colors. However, they’re less yellow than other species. For the most part, they’re black with iridescent blue scaling. Their underside features white, yellow, and orange markings, though. Like all swallowtails, they have distinctive wings that look like tails.\nThey’re commonly found in the woodlands, fields, and gardens. They feed on many different plants. However, the caterpillars on consume the leaves of certain plants, like pipevines. These plants contain toxins that make the caterpillars unpalatable to predators.\nThey’re known for their fast, darting pattern, which allows them to get away from predators verty quickly. They’re also known for their unique courtship behavior, which involves males darting around in large groups and competing to attract females.\nThese butterflies are not endangered. However, they are harmed by habitat loss and pesticide use. Conservative efforts have begun to prevent their population from decline.\nUp Next:\n5 Animals That Go Through Metamorphosis & How They Do It\n10 Poisonous Butterflies\n10 Rarest Butterflies in the World\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

In fact, the state is littered with lakes . There are over 7,000 lakes found throughout Texas, making it a lot damper than you might have thought. To be fair, it’s mostly in the eastern and central parts of the state but nevertheless, there is plenty of water in the Lone Star State . Although there’s a lot to explore throughout the state, below we zoom in to discover the deepest lake in Harris County.\nBarker Reservoir in Harris County, Texas\nThe deepest lake in Harris County is located near Houston, Texas.\n©Silvio Ligutti/Shutterstock.com\nThe Barker Reservoir is the deepest lake in Harris County . It sits on the county’s west side and takes up space in two other counties, including Fort Bend and Waller. It spans a total of 126 square miles and is 102 feet deep. In 1945, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers finished the Barker Dam and today, they both own and operate the Barker Reservoir alongside its sister reservoir, Addicks Reservoir.\nWhy Was the Barker Reservoir Created?\nThe Barker Reservoir was part of a federal project to limit flooding. The intention was to protect those in the downtown portion of Houston and the Buffalo Bayou. The reservoir has two main streams that include Upper Buffalo Bayou and Mason Creek. It has a total of 69 miles of streams and 51 of those are found within Harris County lines.\nFlooding in Harris County, Texas\nBoth Barker Reservoir and Addicks Reservoir performed well protecting downtown Houston for over 70 years. However, Hurricane Harvey was too much for them to handle. This hurricane arrived with a vengeance and flooded the immediate environment on either side of the dams. 25,000 houses and businesses flooded. Water levels reached so high so quickly that 37 people lost their lives within the county.\nIt became abundantly clear to both the Corps and its partner, the Harris County Flood Control District, that they needed to put a plan together to protect the people on either side of the dams from ever having to experience such a horrific tragedy again. The solution requires massive changes to the reservoir’s infrastructure. An underground tunnel where water could be funneled is a viable solution. However, the project is still about a decade away from even starting.\nWildlife in Harris County, Texas\nThroughout Texas, you can find a rich wild animal population and it’s not too different in Harris County. Although wild animals deserve their space, there are some animals in the county that may carry rabies and should be avoided like the plague. Those animals include coyotes , foxes , raccoons , bats , and skunks. Other wildlife that you can spot throughout Harris County includes snakes and other reptiles, armadillos,\nopossums , squirrels , bobcats , deer , alligators , turtles , rodents , and hawks and owls.\nUp Next:\nThe 15 Deepest Lakes in the United States\nThe 10 Most Alligator Infested Lakes in the United States\nThe Most Snake-Infested Lakes in Texas\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

That’s right: the eastern coast of the United States is home to a mountain that no novice should attempt to conquer.\nReady to learn more and find out just what American mountain is considered one of the most dangerous in the entire world? Keep reading below!\nMost Dangerous Mountains: Eastern United States\nBelieve it or not, it can actually be a tricky process to determine exactly which mountains in the world can be considered the most dangerous. This is because there are many different factors that come into play. Not every aspect is applicable to every mountain. \nThere are two factors that can determine whether or not a mountain should be considered the most dangerous, however. The first would be the environment of the mountain. This includes altitude, weather and climate, and the wilderness that makes up the mountainside. The next would be human fatalities.\nExploring and hiking mountains is a hobby that many people both in the United States and around the world share. However, like with most hobbies and sports, it can be dangerous. With certain mountains, the risk of injury and even death can be elevated due to the mountain’s natural conditions, which can increase the likelihood of a mountain being labeled a dangerous mountain. \nSo, with that background information, what mountain on the east coast meets the requirements to be a dangerous mountain? Look no further than Mount Washington in New Hampshire.\nThe most dangerous mountain on the east coast of the United States is Mount Washington in New Hampshire.\n©David Boutin/Shutterstock.com\nAbout Mount Washington\nMount Washington is located in New Hampshire, one of many mountains comprising the iconic Appalachian Trail. With its peak sitting over a mile tall at 6,288 feet, it is considered the highest peak in the northeastern region of the United States . It is one of the mountains in the Presidential Range of the White Mountains.\nThis large mountain has been an important part of the local culture long before it developed its English name. Prior to the arrival of English settlers in the area, the indigenous peoples who called this northeastern region home had several names for Mount Washington. Some of these names include Kodaak Wadjo (“summit of the highest mountain”), Agiochook (“the place of the Great Spirit”), and Waumbik (“white rocks”). For many of these nations, the mountain was a sacred area and the dwelling place of gods.\nMount Washington has what is known as an alpine climate . Some of the animals you can expect to see here include deer , cougars , black bears , and ground squirrels.\nHow many people have passed while climbing Mount Washington?\nRecord-keeping on the deaths of Mount Washington didn’t begin until 1849, around 30 years after its oldest rail, Crawford Trail, was established. More than 160 people alone have died on Mount Washington, with many more passing away in the surrounding mountains of the Presidential Range. \nWilliam Buckingham Curtis is one of the people to have passed during an expedition on Mount Washington. In modern times, Curtis is known as the father of American amateur athletics. During his life, he maintained different careers in different industries in the world of sports. This includes being a competitor to being an editor. He was 63 when he attempted to climb Mount Washington, only to later pass during a snowstorm.\nNestled in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, Mount Washington is one of the most challenging and treacherous mountains in the United States.\n©Cory Knowlton/Shutterstock.com\nWhy is Mount Washington so dangerous?\nWith dozens of people losing their lives to Mount Washington, you may be wondering what exactly makes this mountain more dangerous than others. This includes others in the Presidential Range.\nThe most dangerous part of Mount Washington is its location. It’s located directly where three different major storm tracks intersect. This means that if any bad weather were to move northeast and pass over the peak of Mount Washington, it’s liable to collide with more storms there. This can create remarkably dangerous storms that rival those seen closer to flat land. \nSome of the highest wind speeds ever recorded by humans can be attributed to Mount Washington. In fact, for around 60 years, it held the record for the highest wind speeds ever. Now, it holds one of the records for the highest speeds outside of major weather events like tornadoes or hurricanes. Just how fast can the wind reach here? Currently, the fastest directly recorded on this mountain is a whopping 231 miles per hour . For reference, very few trains are able to reach speeds of 170 miles per hour, much less speeds of 200!\nThere is also the overall temperature on the mountain . Due to elevation, it’s not uncommon to see mountains and their peaks easily reach temperatures below freezing. However, when you pair in wind chill and bad weather, Mount Washington can quickly reach temperatures colder than even those Antarctica regularly sports. \nHowever, the biggest reason that Mount Washington is considered one of the most dangerous mountains is the fact that it’s so accessible.\nMount Washington and Its Visitors\nMount Washington is a popular location in the northeastern region of the United States. Because it’s part of the Appalachian Trail, it regularly sees visitors both local and visiting the area. However, Mount Washington is unique when compared to other mountains. First, Mount Washington is taller than many of the mountains those on the trail will be used to. It also has unique geographic hazards, such as large rocks. This can make it a danger zone for those not properly prepared. \nUp Next:\n10 Important Mountains In The Bible\n10 Awesome Mountains In Michigan\n8 Extinct Volcanoes from Across the World\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

Most of the state is relatively flat, with some low-rolling hills spread throughout. But the northeastern corner of Alabama marks the southernmost point of the Appalachian Mountains. And hidden within the Appalachian foothills, you’ll find Cheaha State Park—home to the highest point in Alabama.\nAlabama’s Piedmont Ecoregion\nThe highest spots in Alabama are located in the Talladega Mountains.\n©Sharon Davies Photography/Shutterstock.com\nThe Piedmont is a plateau region stretching throughout the eastern United States . It’s a transition zone between the coastal plain and the Appalachian Mountains. “Piedmont” literally translates to “foot of the mountains,” signifying its location at the base of the Appalachians.\nThe Piedmont region of Alabama is located in the northeastern part of the state, where the Appalachian Mountains begin to rise from the flat landscape. Alabama’s top five highest points are all located here, in the Talladega Mountains of the Piedmont region.\nRolling hills and ridges, with some steep slopes in places, characterize this ecoregion. The soil is generally thin and rocky, supporting a mix of pine and hardwood forests.\nHow The Talladega Mountains Were Formed\nThe Talladega Mountains contain some of the highest points in Alabama.\n©iStock.com/Jeremy Harbin\nYou’ll find the Talladega National Forest near the east-central side of Alabama. The Talladega Mountains in this area rose slowly over many millions of years through a series of orogenic (mountain-building) events.\nThe primary geological event that caused the Appalachian mountains (including the Talladega subrange) to form was the collision of two continents. About 300 million years ago, the North American and African landmasses collided. This slow squishing together of the continental tectonic plates caused the Earth’s crust to crumple and fold upward, creating the Appalachian Mountains.\nErosion has since weathered and eroded away much of the rock that once made up these high peaks. The Talladega Mountains today are a fraction of their original size and height, but they still tower high above the surrounding landscape.\nWildlife in the Talladega National Forest\nMonarch butterflies pass through the area during their spring and fall migration.\n©iStock.com/mzurawski\nThe Talladega National Forest is home to various animal species, including black bears, coyotes, and white-tailed deer. It’s not common to see foxes and turkeys as well. Birds, including the bobwhite quail and various waterfowl, also call it home.\nThe forest is also home to a few endangered and threatened species:\nRed-cockaded woodpecker\nGopher tortoise\nFlattened Musk Turtle\nYou will also likely see many butterflies depending on the time of year. Alabama hosts over 150 species of butterflies, including Cloudless Sulphurs, Eastern Tiger Swallowtails, and Common Buckeyes. Monarch butterflies are commonly seen in the spring and fall as they pass through the region during their annual migration.\nThe Talladega National Forest is great for hiking, camping, fishing, and picnicking. It’s also a great opportunity to see all of Alabama’s top five highest points (plus a few other scenic peaks).\nThe Top 5 Highest Points in Alabama\nAlabama has various high points and peaks that don’t fail to dazzle.\n©Gustavo Frazao/Shutterstock.com\n5. Parker High Point – 2,188 feet\nParker High Point is the 5th highest point in Alabama, and it is one of the southernmost peaks of the Talladega Mountains.\nYou can take multiple trails to get to the summit, but the main one is the Nubbin Creek Trail. This well-maintained trail takes you past a beautiful series of cascades and waterfalls , then over the Little Caney Head peak (1,877 feet) just before reaching Parker High Point.\n4. Bald Rock Mountain – 2,283 feet\nBald Rock Mountain is 2,283 feet and at the end of Cheaha State Park\n©Liebra/Shutterstock.com\nThe 4th highest point in Alabama is the summit of Bald Rock Mountain on the northern end of the Cheaha State Park.\nA short wooden boardwalk leads you to the top of a large rock outcropping, where you’ll be rewarded with sweeping views of the surrounding hills and valleys. This is the Doug Ghee Accessible trail, and it’s one of the best wheelchair-accessible trails in the state.\nYou can also take one of the side trails off the boardwalk for a more challenging hike through the area.\n3. Hernandez Peak – 2,306 feet\nHernandez Peak is the 3rd highest peak in Alabama. It is located on the southern end of Cheaha State Park.\nThe Pinhoti Trail to the summit is considered to be more challenging, with a rugged incline and lots of uneven terrains. This path will also take you to the nearby McDill Point (2,126 feet), just a short distance from Hernandez Peak.\n2. Odum Point – 2,343 feet\nThe 2nd highest point in Alabama is Odum Point. It is just west of Parker High Point.\nYou can reach Odum Point by taking the Pinhoti Trail south from Hernandez Peak and McDill Point. Or the Nubbin Creek Trail from Parker High Point also intersects with the Odum Trail, which leads to the summit.\nYou’ll see several amazing waterfalls, cascades, and rock formations on the way. You can also find campsites nearby if you want to stay a little while longer.\n1. Cheaha Mountain – 2,405 feet\nCheaha Mountain is located in Alabama and is at the tip of the Appalachian Mountain chain.\n©iStock.com/JimVallee\nThe highest point in Alabama is the peak of Cheaha Mountain. Cheaha is derived from the Choctaw word meaning “high.”\nAs the namesake of Cheaha State Park, Cheaha Mountain is a popular destination for hikers and campers. At the easily accessible summit is Bunker Tower, a stone observation tower built in the 1930s. You’ll also see radio towers and the transmitter tower for Alabama Public Television WCIQ.\nThe numerous trails in this area provide multiple lookout points and scenic vistas. You can also find many cabins and campsites throughout the state park so you can stay and enjoy all that Cheaha has to offer.\nUp Next:\n10 Important Mountains In The Bible\n8 Extinct Volcanoes from Across the World\n10 Awesome Mountains In Michigan\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

Around 300 million years ago, the continents drifted toward each other and collided together to form a supercontinent called Pangea .\nThe Appalachian Mountains rose when Earth’s continents collided together to form Pangea.\n©ManuMata/Shutterstock.com\nThere were some smaller crunches before this that began shaping the land. One of these involved a collision with a series of volcanic islands . But the “big crunch” occurred when the North American tectonic plate and the African plate collided . The land of Connecticut was caught in the middle of this huge collision.\nThe Earth’s crust crumpled and buckled, creating the Appalachian Mountain range. At one point in time, it’s estimated that the mountains were 20,000-30,000 feet tall. That’s five times taller than they are now!\nThe “Great Crack” That Split Connecticut\nApproximately 200 million years ago , Pangea began to split apart into the continents we know today. The land “cracked” open as the tectonic plates pulled away from each other.\nA rift valley forms when two plates pull apart from each other, causing the land in the middle to sink down. This is what happened with the Connecticut River valley.\nWhile earthquakes are mild and uncommon in present-day Connecticut, they were not uncommon during the splitting of Pangea. These earthquakes further lowered the lowland area in the state and helped raise the neighboring uplands.\nThis rifting also provoked volcanic activity in the area. For example, the famous Sleeping Giant of Hamden, Connecticut, was formed by volcanic activity during this time. Magma pushed up through the cracks and seams in the Earth’s surface and cooled to form this traprock mountain.\nGlaciers “Scraped” the Land to Form Connecticut’s Current Landscape\nOver the past 200 million years, the Appalachian Mountains have slowly been eroded away by wind and rain. The glaciers of the Ice Age played a big role in eroding the mountains and shaping the landscape that we see today.\nAs the Ice Age glaciers receded and melted, they scraped away the rocks underneath and deposited the sediment in the lowlands. The high peaks were worn down to stumps compared to what they once were. The tallest peaks in Connecticut today are only a tenth of what they were 200 million years ago!\nThe Top 5 Highest Points in Connecticut\nThe summit of Bear Mountain is part of the famous Appalachian Trail.\n©EWY Media/Shutterstock.com\n5. Bradford Mountain — 1,962 feet\nThe fifth highest peak in Connecticut is Bradford Mountain. It is located in Canaan, Connecticut, in the Northwest corner of the state.\nThere are no official trails to the summit, and it’s on private land, so it’s not easily accessible to the public. However, the Iron Mountain Trail in the Housatonic State Forest passes by the base of the mountain.\n4. Bald Peak — 1,997 feet\nBald Peak is the fourth-highest mountain in Connecticut. It’s located in the northwest corner of the state near the border with New York. Bald Peak is a part of the Taconic Mountain subrange of the Appalachians.\nIf you’re hiking the Appalachian trail through Connecticut, you’ll see Bald Peak in the west immediately after passing over Lion’s Head (1,734 feet, Connecticut’s 10th highest point). But there aren’t any paths to the summit of Bald Peak.\n3. Gridley Mountain — 2,192 feet\nGridley Mountain is the third highest point in Connecticut. The 3 tallest mountains in Connecticut are all located close together, just a mile and a half from the northwest corner of Connecticut (at the border of New York and Massachusetts ).\nGridley Mountain and the others are also part of the Taconic Mountain. This mountain is also on private land and has no official trails to the summit.\n2. Round Mountain — 2,280 feet\nThe second highest point in Connecticut is Round Mountain. As the name implies, it is a rounded mountain with a relatively gentle slope.\nIt’s a relatively easy and quick climb to the summit on the Mt. Frissell trail. This is a popular path connecting the Appalachian Trail to the South Taconic Trail.\nThe peak of Round Mountain is just barely within Connecticut. The northern slope of the mountain is actually located across the border in Massachusetts.\n1. Bear Mountain — 2,323 feet\nAt 2,323 feet, Bear Mountain has the highest peak in Connecticut. You’ll reach this point by following the famous Appalachian Trail . From the top of Bear Mountain, you can continue on the Appalachian Trail northwards into Massachusetts, or take the trail West toward Bear Mountain and Mount Frissell.\nAt the summit of Bear Mountain is an inscribed stone marker that reads:\n“This monument marks the highest ground in Connecticut 2354 feet above the sea. Built A.D. 1885. Owen Travis. Mason.”\nHeight estimates of Bear Mountain have been revised since that inscription was created and placed. It’s now known that this peak is not actually the highest ground in Connecticut…\nAlso: Mount Frissell — 2,454 feet\nAlthough Mount Frissell is taller than Bear Mountain, it is not fully located in Connecticut. The peak of Mount Frissell is in Massachusetts, just north of the border.\nHowever, the southern slope of the mountain extends into Connecticut. At the border, the slope is measured to reach a height of 2,379 feet. So, even though the peak is not in Connecticut, the highest point in the state is found on the southern slope of Mount Frissell. Visitors have stacked a cairn of stones at this spot to mark its significance.\nYou can reach the summit of Mount Frissell on the same trail that reaches the top of Round Mountain, which is less than a half-mile away. Many hikers ascend both summits on the same trip. Since Mount Frissell has a flatter summit surrounded by trees, most reports suggest that Round Mountain’s summit provides a nicer view.\nUp Next:\n10 Important Mountains In The Bible\n8 Extinct Volcanoes from Across the World\n10 Awesome Mountains In Michigan\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

It is most well known for its diverse mix of cultures and traditions, ranging from the French and Spanish settlers to the Creoles/Cajuns and the Indians. \nLouisiana is also famous for the port city of New Orleans, a common shipping destination and the birthplace of jazz music.\nWhere is Driskill Mountain, and is it a Real Mountain?\nDriskill Mountain is part of the Bienville Parish, located near Shreveport, Ruston, and Grambling.\n©iStock.com/Nancy Strohm\nDriskill Mountain is located on private property in the middle of Northern Louisiana, only a short drive off of the 507 freeway. Louisiana is divided into parishes instead of counties, a tradition that comes from its French and Spanish heritage. Driskill Mountain is part of the Bienville Parish, located near Shreveport (Louisiana’s major city) and Ruston and Grambling, two popular neighboring college towns. \nThe Bienville Parish is beloved for its fishing and hunting, as it offers many lakes and forests in the surrounding area. Their forestry commodity alone is valued at over $47 million dollars.\nThe easiest way to find Driskill Mountain is to head to the Mount Zion Presbyterian Church in the town of Arcadia. If you follow the dirt road behind the church’s cemetery and into the pine wood trees you will be able to follow trail signs that point the way.\nEven though Driskill Mountain is not on public land, the owners of the area permit visitors as long as they leave no trace on the mountain and refrain from loud or rowdy behavior.\nWhile an elevation of 535 feet would usually qualify as a hill in most states, Louisiana as a whole is one of the lowest places in the nation, with an average height of only 100 feet above sea level. Its highest area is the third lowest in the United States, while its lowest spot (in New Orleans) is eight feet below sea level.\nAccordingly, Driskill Mountain qualifies as a mountain for the state of Louisiana, and the only mountains lower than Driskill are Ebright Azimuth in Delaware and Britton Hill in Florida. The terrain in the area is largely forest, which is common for this section of Louisiana and northeastern Texas, with a significant amount of ferrous sandstone in the soil. You can also find plenty of dogwood and azalea plants in the area.\nThere are a few buildings in the city of New Orleans that stand taller than Driskill Mountain, including the Hancock Whitney Center (priorly known as One Shell Square) and Place St. Charles skyscrapers in the city’s downtown section.\nHow Was Driskill Mountain Formed?\nDriskill Mountain is the result of the erosion of fine silt during the Paleogene period , a relatively recent geologic occurrence (the first of three during the Cenozoic era) that accounts for less than 1% of geologic time. The developments of this shift can be observed much closer to the Earth’s surface as a result. The Paleogene period spanned from 66 million to 23 million years ago.\nThe peak of Driskill Mountain is comprised of nonmarine quartz sands that date back to the Cockfield Formation, a geologic formation that originally occurred in Mississippi during the Paleogene period. \nMost of Driskill Mountain was created by the Cook Mountain Formation (also dating back to the Paleogene) and is comprised of coastal/marine silt and clay. \nWho is Driskill Mountain Named After?\nDriskill Mountain is named for James Christopher Driskill, a former soldier from Henry County, Georgia. He was born on June 27, 1817. He sold his land in Macon, Georgia, in October of 1859 and moved his family of eleven (which included his wife Eugenia, one daughter, and eight sons) to Louisiana, where he had bought 320 acres of timber and farmland from Nathan P. Smith. His plot eventually grew to include 960 total acres, but part of his original purchase included what is now known as Driskill Mountain.\nWhen Civil War broke out in 1861, James Driskill joined the Home Guard, a confederate militia whose function was to serve as the last line of defense for their respective home fronts. The Home Guard was comprised of any male between 18 and 50 years who could not serve in the Confederate army. William, the eldest Driskill, perished in Virginia on May 5, 1864, in the Battle of the Wilderness, and another one of his sons vanished in the war. \nDriskill sold two acres of land to the trustees of the Mount Zion congregation for $5 on June 26, 1883. They joined forces with a local Presbyterian Church and constructed the Mount Zion Presbyterian Church that still stands today, as well as the Driskill Memorial Cemetery.\nWith the exception of one daughter and son, the family of James Christopher Driskill stayed on their land after the war. Most of his family line currently resides in Bienville Parish.\nWhat Are The Five Highest Points in Louisiana?\nEagle Hill is five miles west of the Kisatchie National Forest, the only National forest in Louisiana.\n©iStock.com/tornado98\nThe five highest points in Louisiana are Driskill Mountain (535 feet), Athens Lookout Tower (500 feet), Sabine Parish High Point (490 feet), Vernon Parish High Point (484 feet), and Webster High Point (480 feet).\nAthens Lookout Tower is in the city of Athens in Claiborne Parish. It is one of six lookout towers in the parish, including the Antiock Lookout Tower, The Blackburn Lookout Tower, KLVU-AM, KWHN-FM, and the Rocky Hill Lookout Tower. Athens is named for the capital of Greece, and it reportedly was the head city of the Claiborne Parish in 1846 before a fire broke out two years later and wiped out the courthouse records. The city of Homer is the current parish seat. \nThe Sabine Parish High Point is comprised of five mountains, the tallest of which is Eagle Hill. Eagle Hill reaches a height of 456 feet and leads north to the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas. This mountain is also five miles west of the pinewood expanses of the Kisatchie National Forest, the only National forest in Louisiana. \nThere is currently a radio tower and abandoned artillery observation tower (Eagle’s Roost) atop Eagle Hill, but it is also renowned for being the site of many unearthed Native American artifacts. There was also a temporary Air Force Station at Eagle Hill during the Vietnam War.\nThe Vernon Parish High Point is the colloquial name for an unofficial highpoint on land that is joint-owned by the Fort Polk Wildlife Management Area and the Fort Polk Military Reservation. Vernon Parish was started in 1871 during the Reconstruction era, and today it has a population of over 50,000, making it the largest parish in Louisiana. \nThis area has been a profitable location for the timber industry, as it is replete with pine trees and has a railway that was built in 1897 to assist in transporting lumber and workers. Leesville is the parish seat of Vernon Parish, but the parish itself covers 1,341 square miles (14 miles of which is water). The construction of Fort Polk in the middle of World War II created significant employment opportunities for the area, and the local population grew over five times larger in the years immediately after its founding.\nThe fifth and final high point in Louisiana is the Webster Parish High Point. This is a part of four mountains in Webster Parish: Indian Mound (144 feet), Big Mound (194 feet), Bull Hill (423 feet), and Duncan Hill (the highest at 427 feet). This area is considered part of the Kisatchie National Forest, and the Parish was named in honor of Daniel Webster, a U.S. statesman and Secretary of State under President Harrison.\nUp Next:\n11 Lakes In Louisiana\nDiscover the 8 Best National and State Parks in Louisiana\nDiscover the 5 Highest Points East of the Mississippi River\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

However, these social underwater creatures are so much more than their unique appearance. Of all the whales, belugas are the most vocal. They display an exceptional ability to swim backward, which aids them as they navigate arctic waters. Although known for their white color, they don’t develop this color until about eight years into their lives. Beluga whales are actually born dark gray. They survive icy waters with their tough dorsal ridges and lots of blubber to keep them insulated. Unfortunately, belugas are endangered, facing a slew of threats from climate change, humans, and predators. To get an opportunity to behold the magnificence of these sea creatures in person, you can visit one of the aquariums with beluga whales.\n4 Aquariums with Beluga Whales\n1.

They are beautiful, tall, and filled with unique fauna and flora. Although many people hike mountain trails daily, there is always a risk. It’s rare for an accident to happen on a mountain, however, it’s still good to be prepared.\nInterestingly, some mountains in Montana are considered more dangerous than others. Follow along to learn about the most dangerous mountains in Montana and why.\nGranite Peak in the Beartooth Mountains\n©jfisher2167 / CC BY 2.0 – License\nClimbing mountains comes with a risk. Anything can happen, including animal attacks, dehydration, sickness, and accidents. Although Montana doesn’t have the most mountain-related accidents, it’s likely because the number of mountain climbers is lower than in other states. Still, some gruesome and heartbreaking deadly accidents have happened in the many mountains, which is why it is wise to know about the dangerous mountains in Montana.\nEvery year, some people attempt to climb Granite Peak within the Beartooth Mountains. The peak sits at an elevation of 12,807 feet. This is the highest natural point in Montana and the 10th highest in the country. Not many climbers attempt this peak since it’s considered to some as the second most difficult state high point to climb.\nIn 2020, a few climbers experienced accidents while climbing Granite Peak. While trying to cross a dangerous area called the Snow Bridge, a man slipped and fell 100 feet. He was rescued. However, four men from Idaho the same day experienced another accident while rappelling on a slope. They anchored into a large border, but it gave away. One of the four was injured, while the others died after falling about 1,000 feet. These are just two incidents.\nMount Cleveland\nGlacier National Park, Montana houses a beautiful mountain that sits at an elevation of 10,479 feet claiming five climbers.\n©iStock.com/TheBigMK\nMount Cleveland is another one of the most dangerous mountains in Montana. It is a large mountain in Glacier National Park. Although it’s not the tallest mountain in the state, it boasts some spectacular views and daring slopes. This beautiful mountain sits at an elevation of 10,479 feet. Although some people may have climbed Mount Cleveland previously, the first recorded ascent was in 1920 by Frank B. Wynn. Most climbers begin their adventure in the Waterton Valley. Other routes are considered more dangerous and best left to professionals. Although this mountain is relatively safe, a shocking accident killed five climbers, making it one of the most deadly mountains in Montana.\nIn 1969, just two days after Christmas, five brave mountain climbers were swept away and killed by an avalanche. Clare Pogreba, Ray Martin, Jerry Kanzler, Jim Anderson, and Mark Levitan attempted to climb the mountain and told everyone not to worry and that they would be back by January 2nd. However, they didn’t make it back. Instead, on January 3rd, families, friends, and volunteers searched for the boys. They found ski tracks leading to an abandoned base camp and some footprints in the snow. Because of the harsh conditions, their bodies weren’t found for another five months. This tragic accident changed their community forever.\nDusty Star Mountain\nDusty Star Mountain at Glacier National Park in Montana has claimed two lives.\n©iStock.com/Jonathan W. Cohen\nThe Dusty Star Mountain is a popular mountain in Montana and is one of the most dangerous mountains in Montana. It sits at an elevation of 8,573 feet. While it’s not the tallest mountain in Montana, it is widely photographed. Tourists can see a spectacular view of this mountain near Wild Goose Island. This stunning mountain is also very old and first started uplifting 170 million years ago. During winter, Dusty Star Mountain is very cold, with temperatures dropping well below −10 °F.\nSadly, a few accidents and tragedies have claimed lives here. For example, in 2022 two friends and mountain climbing veterans, Brian Kennedy and Jack Beard fell to their deaths while climbing the sheer north face of Dusty Star Mountain. They were both well-known in their community and were part of the Glacier Mountaineering Society. A recovered photo of the two standing on the summit of the 8,084-foot peak has experts believing they fell on their descent between 600 to 1,000 feet.\nLone Mountain\nLone Peak Mountain in Big Sky Resort is one of the most dangerous mountains in Montana.\n©iStock.com/Gypsy Picture Show\nAnother dangerous mountain in Montana is Lone Mountain. It’s in the Madison Range. You can find the summit in Lee Metcalf Wilderness within Gallatin and Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forests. The elevation of the mountain is 11,167 feet. A large ski resort, Big Sky Resort also occupies parts of Lone Mountain.\nWhile most of the mountain-related deaths in this article have to do with climbing, skiing, and snowboarding also comes with a risk. In 2012, a 24-year-old skier, Bradley Gardner, lost his life after going out alone. About a decade later, a snowboarder also lost his life. On the North Summit Snowfield of Lone Mountain, 29-year-old Chandler Pelletier of Belgrade fell to his death. He was found unresponsive and sadly while officials tried to revive the snowboarder, they were unsuccessful.\nRising Wolf Mountain\nRising Wolf Mountain is located in Glacier National Park, Montana, and is known as a dangerous mountain.\n©iStock.com/Chris LaBasco\nNext on our list of the most dangerous mountains in Montana is Rising Wolf Mountain, another popular mountain in the Lewis Range, within Glacier National Park. The mountain has an elevation of 9,513 feet. The peak is very noticeable since it rises above the Two Medicine region. Rising Wolf Mountain experiences cold and harsh winters with wind chill factors below −30 °F. Another name for this mountain is “Mahkuyi-opuahsin”, meaning, “the way the wolf gets up”. This name was given by the Blackfoot who consider the Two Medicine region as sacred ground.\nThe most recent incident in Rising Wolf Mountain happened in July 2022. A 79-year-old Florida man fell while climbing an off-trail slope with a group of friends. His friends called for help and he was transported by helicopter to the Two Medicine Ranger Station. However, the air ambulance crew pronounced the climber dead from his injuries. He likely fell several hundred feet.\nMount Brown\nMount Brown in Glacier National Park, Montana, is known for being the site of a 19-year-old’s death.\n©iStock.com/Florence and Joseph McGinn\nAnother beautiful and tall mountain in Glacier National Park is Mount Brown. The mountain sits at an elevation of 8,589 feet. While visiting Mount Brown, you can also see the historic Mount Brown Fire Lookout built in 1928. It’s located on the southwestern slopes of Mount Brown. Interestingly, there is a constant debate over who the mountain is named after. One theory suggests it was named for William Brown of Chicago, while others believe it was named for Louis Brown, a Montana pioneer.\nSadly, another life tragically ended in Mount Brown. Winslow Nichols, of Columbia Falls, a 19-year-old climber was reported missing by his friend and climbing partner. The two planned to climb the mountain together. Winslow Nichols fell to his death and his body was recovered after being spotted by a helicopter.\nUp Next:\n10 Important Mountains In The Bible\n10 Awesome Mountains In Michigan\n8 Extinct Volcanoes from Across the World\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

The island, which many indigenous people of Alaska inhabited, was devasted by Japanese occupancy. The event resulted in hysteria among Americans, a blood-soaked battle between the United States and Japanese forces, and the loss of several American, Japanese, and indigenous Alaskan lives. Today, the island signifies an important but often forgotten story of hardship and war.\nWhile the island’s history lives on through its resident’s descendants, its original inhabitants’ culture, art, and language appear to be fading away. However, the island’s climate, natural landscape, wildlife and other islands remain. Find out which island in Alaska was the site of a World War II battle and discover what natural characteristics make this island so unique.\nWhat are the Aleutian Islands?\nThe Aleutian Islands are part of an island chain in Alaska.\n©iStock.com/Daniel Mark Robertson\nThe Aleutian Islands comprise a chain of islands that sit on the southwestern tail of the state of Alaska. These islands act as a border between the Bering Sea and the Pacific Ocean . They stretch a length of 1,100 miles. The westernmost island and the westernmost point of the United States takes the form of Attu Island, where a battle occurred during World War II.\nThe Ring of Fire is a colloquial term for a portion of the Aleutian Islands where numerous volcanoes and mountaintops reside. While many volcanoes are dormant within the island chain, some remain active. For instance, the Shishaldin Volcano is an active volcano that lies within the Aleutian Islands.\nAleutian Islands: Climate\nThe climate in the Aleutian Islands includes abundant rainfall, frequent winds, fog, and consistent temperatures throughout the year. Plant life in the island chain lacks many trees, but it includes various flowering plants and grasses. Large portions of the Aleutian Islands, spanning some 4,250 square miles, are protected by the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge .\nIndigenous to the Aleutian Islands were the Unangan, also known as the Aleut tribe. The people group lived undisturbed in the island chain for approximately 8,000 years. When Russia began to explore the islands, a recorded 25,000 Unangans lived there. The first to discover the islands were Vitus Bering and Aleksey Chirikov. Bering first found the western portion of the Aleutian Islands, and Chirikov discovered the eastern portion. After news of the discovery reached Russia’s mainland, hunters moved into the Aleutian Islands, hoping to become rich off the fur trade, as many animals with sought-after furs resided there.\nAs Russia gained control over Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, they greatly oppressed the Unangan people. Many Unangans were killed, forced to move, or enslaved by the Russians. Eventually, though, Russia gave over Alaska to the United States. In 1867, the United States gained control of Alaska and its Aleutian Islands through the Alaska Purchase .\nWildlife in the Aleutian Islands\nAleut man’s hat on display at Peabody Museum at Harvard University.\n© – License\nWildlife within the island chain is diverse and unique to the region. Land animals range from foxes to caribou , and humans introduced most land mammals. Sea mammals include the northern sea otter, the harbor seal , and the Steller sea lion. Fish species in the Aleutians include cod, sablefish, pollack, sand lance, herring, and more.\nHowever, the most prominent animals within the Aleutian Islands are birds. Over 10 million birds make nests in the region during the summer season. The most common birds of the Aleutians are puffins , gulls, and kittiwakes, to name a few. One colony of northern fulmars includes 1.5 million members. This colony can be found on Chagulak Island within the Aleutians. Furthermore, approximately half of the emperor geese population across the globe lives in the Aleutian Islands during winter. Some bird species in the Aleutians cannot be found anywhere else on the North American continent. These include tufted ducks, black-headed gulls, Siberian ruby-throats, whooper swans, far eastern curlews, and wood sandpipers.\nAttu Island\nShishaldin is the tallest volcano located in Alaska.\n©NOAA Photo Library / flickr – License\nThe westernmost point of the United States, Attu Island, experienced the only World War II battle ever to take place in North America. The island sits just 500 miles east of Russia and is a vast tundra plagued by storms across all seasons. Attu Island is unique because its climate and characteristics make it one of Earth’s grimmest and most formidable locations. Bodies of water in and around Attu Island include Holtz Bay, Massacre Bay, and the Chichagof Harbor. While a few Aleut tribal villages once settled in Attu, they were destroyed during the Japanese occupation.\nIn 1942, Japan occupied Attu Island, which triggered panic throughout the American Homefront. The idea that Japan could lay claim over United States territory during the war was frightening. Some believed it was the start of other Japanese occupations in the United States. When Japan bombed Dutch Harbor, many Unangans were relocated from the Aleutian Islands to Southeast Alaska.\nWhen Japan invaded Attu Island, Unangan residents were taken as prisoners of war. The Japanese starved the Unangan, which resulted in death for approximately half of the Attu Unangan. Those that survived being prisoners of war were relocated to Atka in the Aleutian Islands; they never returned home to Attu Island.\nIn May 1943, troops from the United States went head-to-head with Japanese soldiers on Attu Island. Fighting between the two armies lasted several days until the United States wiped out Japanese forces. Of the 1,000 Japanese soldiers to advance in the final battle, only 29 survived. For the United States, 1,750 causalities were recorded, most of which directly resulted from Attu’s unfavorable climate conditions.\nAttu Island’s involvement in WW2\nThe World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument now includes a tribute to the U.S. soldiers who fought and lost their lives during the battle at Attu Island. Furthermore, remnants of trenches, shrapnel, shells, and more can be encountered across the eastern part of Attu Island. Bits and pieces of history can be found in the formidable tundra Attu, paying tribute to the sacrifices made by U.S. soldiers and the Unangan people.\nWhile a crucial battle occurred on Attu during the Japanese occupation, the island served other purposes during World War II. For example, the United States used Attu Island as a launch site for bombs sent over to Japan during the war. Following the battle, airfields, roads, and camps were constructed on Attu Island. One unique feature left from the war is an over 3,000-foot-long bombproof storage tunnel on the island.\nLost Villages of the Aleutians was a project that served to commemorate and memorialize Unangan life following the battle at Attu Island and the end of World War II. Lost Villages of the Aleutians recorded a history comprised of interviews and secondary sources. The project allowed former Attu Island residents and descendants of Attu Island residents to visit the location, rediscover their cultural history, and honor their ancestors. Sites visited by the Lost Villages project included Makushin, Kashega, and Biorka.\nMemorializing Unanga Life\nIn addition to the Lost Villages of the Aleutians project, former residents of Attu Island and their descendants gathered for an Attu reunion in Anchorage, Alaska, in the fall of 2012. Many attendees shared testimonies and pictures at the reunion. Other events sponsored by the National Park Service and other organizations have allowed Attu descendants to learn more about their history and culture.\nOne former resident of Attu, Nick Golodoff, created a memoir called Attu Boy . Golodoff tells his ongoing story of self-discovery after being taken from Attu Island by the Japanese when he was six years old. Another book called Lost Villages of the Eastern Aleutians tells the story of several Aleutian villages that were devasted by World War II, even though they had remained strong throughout Russian and American sovereignty.\nUp Next:\n7 Islands That No One Can Visit\n10 Most Dangerous Islands in the World\nNo One Lives Here: 10 Uninhabited Islands From Across the World\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

While humans are now conversant with this fact, we weren’t always, allowing us continually make costly mistakes over extended periods. Consequently, many states, islands , countries, and even continents have reported losses of plant and animal species due to human intervention.\nHowever, islands seem to be getting the worst of it, and there’s a perfectly good explanation for this. This article explores 5 islands where invasive snakes caused local wildlife to go extinct. If you’d also like to find out why islands are home to almost 40 percent of all critically endangered animals on record, this article has all you need to know.\nWhy Are Islands More Susceptible To Invasive Species?\nAn island is best defined as a piece of land surrounded by water. Consequently, it has limited resources such as territory, food, prey, and predators. As a result, many native island animals have evolved to feed on a small diet. Animals like these are called specialist species. Other species have also developed new survival skills, thanks to evolution. One such example is the marine iguana found on the Galapagos islands. These reptiles are known to dive into the water to look for food.\nDue to islands’ limited resources and native/specialist species, they have remarkably fragile ecosystems. If, for example, a new species with a similar diet to any native specialist species enters the island, problems could ensue, especially if the island has no predators for this new species. Not only would there be less food and more competition for the native species, but the prey in question would be overhunted. This means that the native species and the prey are at risk of extinction.\nOn the other hand, most invasive species are generalists instead of specialists and simply move on to another species once they have hunted one into extinction. They do this until they hunt the entire island into extinction. Sadly, this happens pretty frequently. Research has shown that invasive species are the primary cause of the extinction of wildlife on islands. In fact, research has also shown that invasive species are responsible for about 42 percent of all threatened or endangered species.\nThis is a huge problem as many species found on islands aren’t seen anywhere else in the world. About 1189 highly threatened vertebrate species are situated on 1288 islands worldwide. This means that once an animal goes extinct on these islands, they are lost forever with all the knowledge that could be gained from studying them. You might wonder how these invasive species get onto islands, but it’s really straightforward; humans are largely responsible. So many animals that have now transformed into invasive species would never have been able to get to their new habitats without humans.  \n5 Islands Where Invasive Snakes Caused Local Wildlife To Go Extinct\nIbiza, Guam, Mallorca, Canary, and Formentera Islands are 5 islands where invasive snake species caused local wildlife to go extinct.\nIbiza\nHorseshoe whip snakes prey on Ibiza’s native wall lizards.\n©iStock.com/amoklv\nIbiza is gaining popularity again, but not for great reasons. Horseshoe whip snakes have begun to wreak havoc on the population of Ibiza wall lizards , the last remaining endemic vertebrate on Ibiza. We know that these colubrid snakes are responsible for the population decline of these lizards because studies prove that Ibiza wall lizards make up at least 56 percent of their diet.\nEarlier research showed that the snake entered Ibiza by hitching rides on ornamental olive plants transported to the island from other territories in the Iberian Peninsula. These snakes now inhabit up to 49.31 percent of the island, which encompasses about 43.04 percent of Ibiza wall lizards’ territory.\nGuam\nBrown tree snakes are responsible for eradicating two of Guam’s three native bat species as well as over half of its native bird species.\n©ijeongyeun/Shutterstock.com\nGuam is the largest island of the Mariana Islands and is located in its southernmost parts. The island currently has about 4 invasive animal species, with the brown tree snake causing the most devastating effects. According to the Invasive Species Compendium , it is responsible for eradicating two of Guam’s three native bat species as well as over half of its native bird and lizard species.\nThese snakes are extremely agile climbers and swift movers, causing them to remove native pollinators, which results in the decline of native plant species. Ecologists have also discovered that Guam has almost 40% more spiders than its surrounding islands because of the eradicated birds that would usually feed on them.\nMallorca Island\nFalse smooth snakes are invasive on Mallorca Island and prey on the island’s native Lilford’s wall lizard.\n©iStock.com/Balate Dorin\nMallorca is the largest of the Balearic Islands, an archipelago in Spanish territory. This territory was invaded by false smooth snakes, colubrid snakes that are now a relatively common sight in Mallorca. False smooth snakes were introduced in historic or prehistoric periods. Since quite some time has passed since their invasion , they are now commonly spotted despite how dangerous they are to Mallorca’s ecosystem. \nThe species is believed to be responsible for the extinction of Lilford’s wall lizard, a lizard native to the Balearic Islands. Sadly, these are not the only invasive species as exotic pets that escape their owners also end up in the wild. These species end up spreading and ultimately become a threat to the ecosystem.\nCanary Islands\nThe California king snake preys on three major native reptiles on the Canary Islands.\n©iStock.com/bluejayphoto\nThe Canary Islands is a popular archipelago in Spanish territory off the coast of northwestern Africa . The California king snake was introduced onto Gran Canaria in 1998 and by 2009 had become a major problem. Despite efforts from the Canary Islands Government to stop their growth, the species has continued to expand.\nA survey showed that this snake has had devastating effects on three reptiles native to the Canary Islands; the Gran Canaria skink , Boettger’s gecko , and the giant lizard of Gran Canaria. Two of these species are important parts of plant reproduction and dispersal, and all three species help keep the populations of certain invertebrates in check.\nFormentera Island\nLadder snakes are invasive in Formentera and are responsible for the decline in Ibiza wall lizard populations.\n©wewi-creative/Shutterstock.com\nFormentera Island is the smallest of all islands in the Balearic archipelago. The island is known for its beautiful waters and is one of the top tourist hotspots. However, despite its beauty, the island of Formentera battles with ladder snakes, an invasive species threatening the populations of some of its native species.\nIt preys chiefly on the island’s native Ibiza wall lizard, as research revealed that these lizards make up to 40 percent of the ladder snake’s diet. They are regarded as an invasive species by the island government and many other surrounding island governments.\nFinal Thoughts\nInvasive snakes are a major problem which is why other islands like Hawaii are already taking measures to eradicate their 7 invasive snake species before the fragile balance of their ecosystem is damaged. This is why it is important to carefully consider the long-term feasibility of owning a pet before purchasing one. While letting it out into the wild might solve a minor problem for you, it definitely causes a larger one in the long run.\nUp Next:\nMeet The Florida Snake Hunters That Have Killed More Than 1,000 Invasive Pythons\nDiscover the Invasive Watersnakes Invading Arizona\n5 Invasive Species in the Mississippi River\nCould 200-Pound Snakes Invade Texas After Making Florida Their Home?\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

It lies in a valley surrounded by the Adirondacks and the Green Mountains. However, Vermont lays claim to most of this extraordinary lake as it spreads over more than half of this Lake Champlain’s 490 square miles. The biggest city on the lake’s shores is Burlington, Vermont. This lake was essential during the Revolutionary War, allowing movement from the colonies to Canada.\nLake Champlain Location\nLone Rock Point on Lake Champlain in Burlington, Vermont.\n©iStock.com/Eifel Kreutz\nThis lake is situated in the northwestern corner of Vermont, spanning over the New York state line westward towards the Canadian border. Montreal, Quebec, is the closest metropolitan area to Lake Champlain (a one-hour drive), followed by Boston (a three-and-a-half-hour drive) and New York City (a five-hour drive). Lake Champlain is divided into five geological sub-basins. For example:\nThe Main Lake from Crown Point to Canada\nSouth Lake runs North from Whitehall to Crown Point\nMalletts Bay\nInland Sea/Northeast Arm\nMissisquioi Bay\nHistory\nSamuel de Champlain was a French explorer that stumbled across Lake Champlain in 1609 and named it after himself. The lake proved its worth during the Revolutionary War when it was an essential transportation system from the colonies to Canada. Additionally, during the War of 1812, it served the military again as they used it to build ships. After World War II in 1945, the lake became a popular tourist attraction and now serves as a vital economic source for the surrounding towns.\nThis gorgeous lake is home to the oldest known fossil reef, between 450 to 480 million years old. In fact, there is a myth that a dinosaur similar to the Loch Ness Monster still occupies the lake. This prehistoric creature is named Champ, and many people have claimed to see him while visiting the lake. Although it’s unknown whether he is a whale, plesiosaur, dinosaur, or even exists, it’s always exciting to go out to Lake Champlain and try to find him.\nSize\nLake Champlain forms a boundary between New York and Vermont for most of its length. Therefore, it has a width of 14 miles, a length of 130 miles, and a total area of 490 square miles.\nDepth\nLake Champlain has an average depth of approximately 64 feet. However, its deepest point is 400 feet between Essex, NY, and Charlotte, VT.\nLake Champlain’s Water Level\nThis lake’s average yearly water level is 95.5 feet.\nFishing\nLake Champlain is considered one of the best bass fishing lakes in the Northeast and contains over 90 species of fish. In addition, Bassmaster Magazine has ranked it the sixth-best lake in the region.\nFish species in Lake Champlain include:\nYellow Perch\nWhite Perch\nBluegill Sunfish\nSmallmouth Bass\nLargemouth Bass\nRock Bass\nBrown Bullhead Catfish\nNorthern Pike\nGeology\nLake Champlain is rated the USA’s eighth naturally occurring body of fresh water. For example, it contains 6.8 trillion gallons of water and provides drinking water to 200,000 people. Geologists get lost in various rocks and landforms belonging to this lake. It also contains the oldest fossil coral reef on the planet and young mountains formed by ancient rocks. Lastly, it is also an excavation site of a 10,000-year-old beluga whale.\nBoating\nLake Champlain is the perfect place to launch a boat, whether it’s a motor, paddle, or sailboat, this lake offers breathtaking views, surrounded by towering mountains, rolling fields, and rocky cliffs. It also offers scenic boat tours so you can let your hair down while admiring the expansive waterways, sandy shores, sheltered bays, and secluded spots encompassed by nature.\nOther Activities\nOrnamental Farm at Shelbourne Farms\nLearn about American history at the North Star Underground Railroad Museum\nBook your accommodation on Knight Island\nGet some exercise on Burlington Bike Path\nEnjoy the walking trails at Waterfront Park\nTake a ferry from Burlington to Port Kent\nShop at Church Street Marketplace\nCamping\nLake Champlain is a camper’s paradise and provides all sorts of outdoor living spaces, like RV parks or old-school camping grounds; no matter what, this lake can accommodate you and your family.\nThere are endless options for your nature-filled getaway:\nLincoln Pond Campground, Elizabethtown, NY\nNoblewood Park, Willsboro, NY\nApple Island Resort, South Hero, VT\nPutnam Pond State Campground, Ticonderoga, NY\nNorth Beach Campground, Burlington, VT\nChamplain Adult Campground, Grand Isle, VT\nBulwagga Bay RV Park & Campground, Port Henry, NY\nPetro’s Millbrook RV Park, Port Henry, NY\nAnchorage, South Hero, VT\nAusable River Campground, Keeseville, NY\nUp Next\nHow Old Are the Great Lakes?\nHow Deep Is Lake Erie?\nWhat Lives at the Bottom of Lake Superior?\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

It’s situated directly beneath Lake Huron, on the edge of the U.S. and Canada border. The glassy lake has a surface area of 25 667 square kilometers, with an average depth of 210 feet. Additionally, Lake Erie links with Lake Ontario via the Niagara River. \nThe lake is one of North America’s most mysterious locations because of the terrifying tales that surround it. For example, some people believe Lake Erie might be cursed due to the hundreds of lives lost in the more than 2,000 shipwrecks that have occurred there. Only 375 ships were ever found—the rest are believed to be at the bottom of the enigmatic lake. Also, a sea monster named Eerie, first spotted in 1783, is said to lurk in the dark depths of the lake.\nLake Erie also claimed hundreds of lives during the  naval battle of 1813  when the British fought the United States for control over the lake, Detroit, and other territories.\nDespite its mysterious reputation and sad history, the lake is a popular spot for anglers and nature lovers —in part because of Lake Erie’s rich biodiversity that includes 107 species of fish. These species include yellow perch, walleye, and white bass. Below, we’ll discuss more interesting facts about glistening Lake Erie!\nLocation\nLake Erie’s western shore is in Michigan, while its eastern coast is in New York.\n©Christopher Meder/Shutterstock.com\nAs mentioned, the lake is located on the terrestrial boundary between the U.S. and Canada, with the Ontario Peninsula to its north. Lake Erie’s western shore is in Michigan, while its eastern coast is in New York. Additionally, Pennsylvania is home to the southern side of the lake. Since the lake’s edge stretches over different territories, the jurisdictions of each region have set up water boundaries to divide the lake’s surface area. Major cities found along Lake Erie’s shore include Cleveland and Toledo in Ohio, as well as Buffalo , New York and Erie, Pennsylvania.\nSince the lake is right below Lake Huron, the Detroit River is its primary water inlet. The lake’s outflow occurs via the Niagara River. The powerful force of the water spins the hydroelectric turbines installed near Niagara Falls to produce electricity for both the United States and Canada.\nSome outflow from Lake Erie seeps into the Welland Canal, which is found near the Saint Lawrence Seaway, diverting water used for ship passages between Port Colborne on the south side of the lake and St. Catharine’s, which is situated on Lake Ontario. The outflow occurs due to a 326-foot elevation difference between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.\nHistory\nLong before Europeans arrived at the shore of Lake Erie, Native American tribes such as the Potawatomi and Ojibwe occupied the land near the lake. One of the Native American tribes called Erie, where the lake gets its name, inhabited the southern edge of the lake. Another tribe called the Attawandaron occupied the northern shore. These tribes relied on fish from the lake as a food source. Unfortunately, both the Erie and Attawandaron tribes were conquered and eliminated by the  Iroquois confederacy in 1655  during the Beaver Wars.\nThe war resulted in the shorelines of Lake Erie remaining uninhabited for many years because the Iroquois used the coast as their hunting ground. However, the Iroquois’ victory was short-lived because they began losing their influence in the region in the early 1700s. As a result, other Native American groups, including the Ottawa, Ojibwe, and Mingo, occupied the desolate shores.\nBefore the Iroquois abandoned the shores, a French explorer named Louis Jolliet discovered Lake Erie in 1669 and wrote about it, becoming the first European to reach the beach. However, it’s speculated that another European named Etienne Brule was actually the first European to sail the lake in 1615. Nevertheless, Lake Erie was the last to be discovered and explored by foreigners among all the Great Lakes because the Iroquois were hostile to traders and explorers near the region.\nAn engineering project dubbed the Erie Canal was initiated in 1817 in Buffalo, New York, to link territories along the northeastern shore for trade. The project was quite ambitious because the canal was designed to stretch from Albany to Buffalo and would cost about $7 million. The primary laborers on the project were Irish immigrants, and the legislative department of the state of New York financed the endeavor.\nSize\nLake Erie, whose coordinates are 42.2 degrees north and 81.2 degrees west, has a 571 feet elevation above sea level. The approximate surface area of the lake is 25,874 square kilometers, with a length of 241 miles and 57 miles of breadth. During winter, Lake Erie is usually the first to freeze among the Great Lakes due to its small size. However, the lake’s southern location and depthless nature make it the warmest lake in the group.\nDepth\nWaterways that pour into Lake Erie’s drainage basin include the Buffalo River.\n©OakleyOriginals / CC BY 2.0 – License\nErie has the least volume out of all the Great Lakes because its average depth is 62 feet. The  deepest point of the lake  is 210 feet. Lake Erie’s shallowest area is the western basin, where the average depth ranges between 25 to 30 feet. Standing waves, known as  seiches , build quickly in the water whenever a slight breeze occurs on the west bay. The powerful waves are unpredictable, making them dangerous for swimmers and boaters alike. \nLake Erie’s shallow nature proved problematic in 1999 when the waters were so warm during summer that they almost failed to cool the reactors of nuclear power plants. Lake Erie’s water temperature rose to nearly 29 degrees Celsius, the temperature limit for cooling nuclear power plants.\nThe lake’s drainage basin stretches for 78 100 square kilometers and is mainly fed by River Detroit, which originates from Lake St. Clair and Lake Huron. Other rivers that pour into Lake Erie’s drainage basin include:\nCuyahoga River\nHuron River\nGrand River\nSandusky River\nBuffalo River\nMaumee River\nThe western basin, which consists of roughly 20 percent of Lake Erie, is the shallowest area, with an average depth of only 24 feet. Due to the fine sediment particles at the bottom of the basin, the site is the most turbulent region on Lake Erie because the sand at the bottom is easily disturbed with every wave and wind gust.\nThe depth of the lake’s central basin ranges between 60 feet and 82 feet, giving it uniformity and stillness. The deepest basin on the lake is the eastern basin, whose depth varies between 80 feet and 210 feet.\nWater Level and Geology\nLake Erie’s retention time, the average amount of time that water remains in a specific lake, is 2.6 years — the shortest retention time of all the Great Lakes. The water level of the lake fluctuates with different seasons. The lowest water level is observed between January and February, while the highest is between June and July.  \nSeiches usually cause short-term high water level changes during storms when southwesterly winds blow across Lake Erie. The fierce waves cause the lake water to pile up on the eastern side, causing damage to the shoreline. In 2003, the water level of Lake Erie in Buffalo increased by 7 feet during a storm, producing 10 to 15 feet waves that rose to 22 feet! Toledo, a shore on the opposite western side of Lake Erie, experienced an identical decrease in water level.\nFishing\nFifty percent of fish caught in the Great Lakes come from Lake Erie. The lake is a habitat for hundreds of fish species, including walleye.\n©FedBul/Shutterstock.com\nLake Erie is a freshwater lake offering one of the largest commercial fisheries globally. The lake has the most abundant fish population because of its mild temperature and warm-water climate. This provides a favorable environment for plankton growth, the primary food source for fish. \nFifty percent of fish caught in the Great Lakes come from Lake Erie. The lake acts as a habitat for hundreds of fish species, including the following:\nBass\nSalmon\nPerch\nTrout\nWalleye\nSmallmouth bass\nPickerel\nThe endangered lake sturgeon  \nThere are a variety of invasive species in the lake as well. The invasive carp, alewife, ruffe, and hydrilla are examples of common non-native fish species that you can find in Lake Erie. The coho salmon population is again declining after failed attempts to breed it. Walleye and yellow perch comprise most of the commercially caught fish, but white bass and significant amounts of rainbow smelt are also captured.\nAlthough various management agencies run the fishery, such as the U.S. states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, and the province of Ontario under the direction of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, the fishery continues to be the subject of significant criticism, mostly from anglers and government fishing businesses based in the U.S.\nThis complex battle began due to modifications to U.S. fisheries management in the 1960s, which resulted in the cessation of commercial fishing in most Great Lakes states. \nFun Activities on Lake Erie\nThe lake is famous for its top-notch fishing, alluring lighthouses, and intimate islands such as Kelleys Island.\n©Adelya Isyanamanova/Shutterstock.com\nIf you plan to visit Lake Erie for fun activities with friends and family, you’re in for a treat! The lake is famous for its top-notch fishing, alluring lighthouses, and intimate islands such as Johnson’s Island, Little Chicken Island, Kelleys Island, Middle Bass Island, and Lost Ballast Island. Here are some of the thrilling and engaging activities that you can enjoy in Lake Erie:\nBoating\nYou can find a boater’s paradise at Ohio’s Lake Erie Shores & Islands. The area is crammed with marinas and temporary dockage, so travelers along the lake have no shortage of locations to find excitement. It is situated on Ohio’s north coast, halfway between Toledo and Cleveland. This coastal area offers a diverse selection of historical landmarks, family-friendly attractions, breathtaking scenery, and outdoor activities.\nNotable ports of call to visit include the mainland ports of Port Clinton/Catawba Island, Marblehead, Sandusky, Huron, and Vermilion, as well as the Lake Erie islands of South Bass/Put-in-Bay, Middle Bass, and Kelleys. Boaters have access to around 90 marinas, most of which provide transient dockage or mooring buoys. \nThe best time for boating and fishing is from mid-April until the end of October. Boaters are welcome everywhere in the area. Visitors arriving by boat can easily access major attractions like the Cedar Point Amusement Park or downtown retail businesses, thanks to marinas with transient dockage.\nCamping\nAnother favorite activity for Lake Erie’s tourists is camping. Even though you can’t camp on the lake’s beach, lovely destinations lie nearby. For instance, you can explore Lake Erie Bluffs Campsite, a quiet, wooded camping zone with refreshing lake breezes. If the weather permits, you’ll enjoy a dramatic and lovely sunset while enjoying a panoramic view of Lake Erie as the sounds of the waves lap against the shore.\nWhile at the camp, you can explore a nearly two-mile stretch of pristine freshwater beach where lake-smoothed stones, driftwood, and unique beach flora are strewn over the sand. You might even see the Fairport Harbor Lighthouse as you scan the beach to the west.\nWe also recommend checking out Camp Sandusky, which is situated on the banks of Lake Erie and is only five minutes from the Jet Express dock and 10 minutes from Cedar Point. The campsite provides Amish-built cabins, tent campsites, and RV sites.\nFrom June 1st through the first week of October, Camp Sandusky is open. Pets are allowed in RVs, pop-up tents, and the new pet-friendly cabins at the campsite, but they are not allowed at the tent sites. The main perk of visiting Camp Sandusky is that U.S. military personnel, AAA members, and Cedar Point season pass holders receive discounts.\nOther Activities\nBesides boating and camping, you can also go kayaking on Lake Erie. Ensure you check out the North Coast Outpost for the perfect beach day. Also, you can access a unique water sports outfitter at Geneva State Park, on the picturesque shoreline of Lake Erie. There are rentable stand-up paddleboards, including multi-rider boards, regular boards, and kayaks, that you can use for the adrenaline-filled experience to make the most of your trip.\nAlternatively, the Harbor Yak is another excellent spot for kayaking on Lake Erie. Kayaks, paddleboards, and canoe rentals are available here too. You can also book cruises on the magnificent Lake Erie and the Ashtabula River. We advise the Ashtabula River tour for individuals who prefer a less challenging ride because the calm river currents make it ideal for smooth paddling.\nExperience the Wonders of Lake Erie\nThe lake also boasts hundreds of islands, several lighthouses, and beautiful beaches perfect for relaxing or swimming.\n©iStock.com/JerryB7\nLake Erie is a brilliantly blue, picturesque body of water with plenty to explore. There are countless archaeological sites to checkout, including shipwreck remains that are thousands of years old. The lake also boasts hundreds of islands, several lighthouses, and beautiful beaches perfect for relaxing or swimming.\nLake Erie’s fishing possibilities are endless. Anglers can easily catch walleye, white bass, and yellow perch.\nIf you’re looking to explore the depths of Lake Erie, whether it’s through swimming, boating, or fishing, you won’t be disappointed. From its rich biodiversity to mysterious tales, the lake offers adventurers a unique and exciting experience.\nUp Next:\nThe 15 Deepest Lakes in the United States\nThe 10 Most Alligator Infested Lakes in the United States\nThe Most Snake-Infested Lakes in Texas\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

It is the second-largest of the Great Lakes by volume and the third-largest by surface area, with Lake Superior and Lake Huron being larger. Lake Michigan borders four states: Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan.\nLake Michigan also has a rich and diverse history as substantial as its size (and it’s already pretty big) that dates back to the Native American tribes that inhabited its shores. It was a vital route for European exploration, trade, and warfare among the French, British, and American colonists.\nToday, Lake Michigan is a popular destination for recreation, tourism, and commerce, with many cities, towns, and attractions along its coast. Let’s learn more about this incredible lake and its impact on the people, trade, and climate in the region.\nLocation\nLake Michigan is located in the northern Midwest United States and borders four states.\n©Frederick Millett/Shutterstock.com\nLake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes of North America and the only one that is totally within the borders of the United States. It has a few states on its borders, including Michigan to the east and north, Wisconsin to the west, Illinois to the southwest, and Indiana to the southeast. It connects with Lake Huron through a strait to the north, meaning technically, the two are a single lake. Lake Michigan is the world’s largest lake by area, located fully in one country. The other Great Lakes are Lake Superior , Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario.\nHistory\nFormed over 1.2 billion years ago, Lake Michigan has been around longer than humans, although we have lived on its shores since the Native Americans.\n©Robert Sarnowski/Shutterstock.com\nLake Michigan has a long and rich history that spans from ancient geological timescales to the present day. The lake originally formed about 1.2 billion years ago when two tectonic plates pulled apart (creating something called a divergent boundary), creating the Mid-Continent Rift. Much later, the lake was inhabited by various Native American tribes, who called it “michi-gami” or “great water”. The first European to reach Lake Michigan was probably Jean Nicolet, a French explorer who was looking for a passage to Asia. He named the lake after the people who lived on its shores, the Puants or the Stinking Water. Later, the lake was claimed by France and then by the United States, the country that currently claims it.\nLake Michigan played an important role in the development of trade, transportation, and industry in the region. It was part of a waterway that connected the Atlantic Ocean with the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. French fur traders and missionaries used the lake to reach Native American villages and establish all sorts of settlements. Later, British and American colonists fought for control of the lake during the French and Indian War and the War of 1812. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Lake Michigan became a major hub for shipping, fishing, and tourism. The lake supported a massing fishery of lake trout, whitefish, perch, and salmon . With its combination of natural resources and industrial development, it’s no wonder that there are some extremely large cities along its borders, including Chicago, Milwaukee, and Green Bay.\nToday, Lake Michigan is an important resource for millions of people who live near it. It provides water (some for drinking and some for crop irrigation), recreation, transportation, and a whole lot more. It is also home to many wildlife species of all sorts. From a legal perspective, it’s part of the Great Lakes system that Canada and the United States collectively administer through various agreements and organizations.\nSize\nLake Michigan is the third largest of the Great Lakes by surface area but the second largest in water volume.\n©Sarah Michals/Shutterstock.com\nLake Michigan is a huge lake that covers a surface area of 22,404 square miles (58,030 square kilometers). That makes it the largest lake in the world that is in one country by surface area. It is also the fifth-largest lake in the world , and the fourth-largest freshwater lake in the world. The lake is 307 miles (494 kilometers) long from north to south and 118 miles (190 kilometers) wide from east to west. The lake has a shoreline length of 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers), plus 238 miles (383 kilometers) for islands. The lake has an average depth of 279 feet (85 meters) and a maximum depth of 923 feet (281 meters). The lake holds a volume of 1,180 cubic miles (4,900 cubic kilometers) of water. Lake Michigan is connected to Lake Huron through the Straits of Mackinac, which are 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) wide and 295 feet (90 meters) deep. The two lakes are technically one lake with the same water level, although we usually treat them as separate in practice.\nDepth\nThe average depth of Lake Michigan is 279 feet, and the deepest point is 923 feet.\n©Thomas Barrat/Shutterstock.com\nLake Michigan is a deep lake that has an average depth of 279 feet (85 meters). That means it is deeper than Lake Erie, Lake Huron, and Lake Ontario, but not as deep as Lake Superior . The lake has a maximum depth of 923 feet (281 meters), which is about the height of a 92-story building. The deepest point is marked with an “x” on something known as a “ bathymetric map ” of the lake. The lake holds a volume of 1,180 cubic miles (4,900 cubic kilometers) of water, which is more than the volume of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario combined. Lake Michigan is connected to Lake Huron through the Straits of Mackinac, which are 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) wide and 295 feet (90 meters) deep.\nWater Level\nThe water level of Lake Michigan is somewhat variable and impacts the surrounding region.\n©Kenneth Keifer/Shutterstock.com\nLake Michigan’s water level varies depending on several factors, such as precipitation, evaporation, runoff, ice cover, and human activities. The water level is measured by several stations around the lake operated by federal agencies . The water level is also forecasted by different models that consider the weather and climate conditions. The water level affects the lake’s ecosystem, shoreline, navigation, recreation, and economy since it is such an important resource for the region.\nThe water level of Lake Michigan has changed over time, from very low to very high levels, just like most other bodies of water . The lowest recorded water level was 576.02 feet (175.58 meters) above sea level in January 1964. The highest recorded water level was 582.35 feet (177.50 meters) above sea level in October 1986. Lake Michigan’s long-term average water level is 578.50 feet (176.25 meters) above sea level.\nThe water level of Lake Michigan is connected to the water level of Lake Huron through the Straits of Mackinac. The water level of Lake Michigan is also influenced by the water levels of Lake Superior, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario through their connecting channels and outflows, but also because of the similarity of the surrounding region’s climate.\nFishing\nLake trout are some of the most important fish that live in Lake Michigan’s waters.\n©Iryna Harry/Shutterstock.com\nLake Michigan is one of the best places in the world for anglers who love freshwater fishing. The lake offers a variety of fish species, fishing techniques, and fishing locations due to its size.\nThe lake is famous for its Salmon and Trout fishing, especially Steelhead, Coho Salmon, Chinook Salmon , Brown Trout, and Lake Trout. These fish were introduced to the lake in the 20th century to control an invasive fish called the Alewife. They thrived in the lake’s cold and deep waters and became a popular target for sportfishing, as well as eating. You can generally fish for these species year-round, but the best time is from spring to fall when they migrate to shallower waters or enter tributary streams.\nThe lake also has other fish species that are native or naturalized, such as Perch, Walleye, Smallmouth Bass , Largemouth Bass, and Muskie. These fish are usually found in warmer and shallower waters near shorelines, reefs, islands , or river mouths. There are guides around the lake for anyone unfamiliar with the region looking to fish.\nGeology\nLake Michigan was created through tectonic plates shifting and melting glaciers carving and filling it up.\n©iStock.com/Focqus, LLC\nLake Michigan has a geology that reflects its long and complex history. The lake was formed about 1.2 billion years ago when two tectonic plates were pulled apart, creating the Mid-Continent Rift. This rift filled with sediments and lava flows over millions of years. The lake basin was further shaped by several cycles of glaciation and deglaciation during the Pleistocene epoch (a period commonly known as the Ice Age), which ended about 10,000 years ago. The glaciers carved out the lake basin, deposited soil, rock, and sediment onto outwash plains, and created tons of natural features such like islands, bays, sand dunes , and beaches.\nLake Michigan is also closely related to the other surrounding lakes from a geological standpoint, especially Huron, since they are connected and geologically considered one lake.\nBoating\nBoating is important for recreation and industry on Lake Michigan.\n©Jillian Cain Photography/Shutterstock.com\nLake Michigan is a great destination for boaters and has plenty of space for people to explore and travel, including little beach towns, marinas, historic lighthouses, islands, fishing spots, and other boating things. The lake has many events and festivals that use boats, including events like the Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac, the Grand Haven Coast Guard Festival, and the Milwaukee Air and Water Show.\nThe diversity of the lake makes it suitable for almost all types of boats. Boats such as sailboats, motorboats, kayaks, and canoes are commonly seen. Also, large barges and shipping boats are often seen on the lake since it is a huge shipping thoroughfare.\nSince Lake Michigan is so huge, boaters going out in certain vessels like sailboats should do the proper research to find out if their vessel is suitable for the weather and climate. Often, the lake is treated as an ocean since it’s so large and the vessels used to travel it need to reflect this .\nCamping\nThere are all sorts of camping opportunities on and around Lake Michigan.\n©Steve Schwettman/Shutterstock.com\nLake Michigan has many campgrounds that offer different amenities, activities, and locations for tents and RVs. Some campgrounds are in national or state parks with access to trails, dunes, playgrounds, and even fossil hunting in some places. Other campgrounds are more isolated, especially ones located on islands requiring a boat to access.\nLike most campgrounds around the United States, Lake Michigan’s campgrounds vary in availability, rates, and rules depending on the season, hook-ups, and pets. Interested campers should check the details of each campground before booking.\nOther Activities\nBoating or camping not your thing? Well, don’t be too worried. Lake Michigan has a LOT more you can do. Some options include:\nSightseeing around the coast. You can find shops, restaurants, museums, galleries, and festivals in places like Traverse City, South Haven, Grand Haven, Ludington, and Harbor Springs. You can also visit the historic lighthouses that used to (and sometimes still do) guide the ships on the lake.\nOther water activities. Stand-up paddle boarding, kayaking, canoeing, or surfing on Lake Michigan can be a lot of fun. You can rent equipment or join a tour to explore the lake and its wildlife. You can also paddle along the rivers and streams that flow into Lake Michigan.\nGo horseback riding or skiing at Ludington State Park. This park is located between Hamlin Lake and Lake Michigan and offers hiking, biking, fishing, kayaking, and playing on the beach. You can also go horseback riding along the trails or dunes.\nRide the dunes. There are a few places where there are massive dunes around Lake Michigan, notably the Silver Lake Dunes located within Silver Lake State Park. You can ride dune buggies or even take your own vehicle out on dunes that reach up to 450 feet from the water!\nUp Next:\nThe 15 Deepest Lakes in the United States\nThe 10 Most Alligator Infested Lakes in the United States\nThe Most Snake-Infested Lakes in Texas\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

Lake of the Woods is a lesser-known lake located in Northern Minnesota on the border with Canada .\nLake of the Woods is the 36th largest lake in the world and 6th largest in the U.S. It is home to hundreds of islands and has a rich ecosystem with countless plant and animal species.\nThe abundant fish population and breathtaking scenery make Lake of the Woods a beloved destination for anglers, nature enthusiasts, and adventurers in Minnesota.\nLocation\nWhile the lake itself is somewhat isolated, there are several small towns and communities located within a short distance.\n©Copernicus Sentinel-2, ESA / CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO – License\nLake of the Woods is located in the most northern area of Minnesota on the border with Canada. This region is very remote and sparsely populated. The closest major cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul, are located about 270 miles to the southeast. The closest major Canadian city is Winnipeg, at a distance of 134 miles.\nWhile the lake itself is somewhat isolated, there are several small towns and communities located within a short distance. Some of the closest towns include Baudette, Warroad, and Angle Inlet. \nThe main commercial hub and largest U.S. city near the Lake of the Woods is Baudette. It has a population of just under 1,000 residents.\nDespite being located far away from major cities, Lake of the Woods is easily accessible by car. It is connected by several state highways. Visitors can also fly into regional airports in Baudette, Warroad, and International Falls. Connecting flights are available from larger cities like Duluth, Minneapolis, and Chicago.\nInterestingly, this large lake separates a small region of Minnesota from the rest of the state, and the country. The region of Northwest Angle is a sparsely populated area of Minnesota. It can only be accessed by taking a boat or driving through Canada.\nHistory\nLake of the Woods was formed after the glaciers withdrew from Minnesota, creating Glacial Lake Agassiz. This body of water eventually shrank and became Lake of the Woods. \nNative Americans have lived in this region for several thousands of years. Some evidence even indicates that tribes thrived in this region as early as 8,000 years ago!\nThe Ojibwe community became the primary inhabitants of the Lake of the Woods area in the 18th century. They established small settlements and asserted their authority over hunting and gathering territories. The Ojibwe relied heavily on the lake’s wild rice and abundant sturgeon population.\nIn the 18th century, the arrival of Europeans saw the establishment of forts and fur trade posts in the area. Initially, the French fur traders were the first to use the Lake of the Woods as a waterway. The North West Company and the Hudson’s Bay Company followed. These companies used the lake as a vital route from Lake Superior to the interior of Northwestern North America. This activity cemented its importance as a transportation hub.\nIn the late 1800s, many wealthy Americans and Canadians flocked to Lake of the Woods to build summer homes. During this time, the lake was essentially put on the map in terms of tourism.\nSize and Depth\nImagine standing at the edge of this sprawling body of water spanning over 1,700 square miles. It would be easy to think you are at the sea, even though this lake is nowhere near the coast.\nLake of the Woods is a huge lake. In fact, the lake is larger than the state of Rhode Island.\nIts average depth is approximately 26 feet, while its deepest point at Whitefish Bay measures up to 310 feet. \nThe lake is also known for the over 14,000 islands scattered across its shores. When accounting for the shorelines of all the islands, the total shoreline stretches to an impressive 65,000 miles. \nIt is fed by the Rainy River and drains into Lake Winnipeg. It has a shallow and irregular shape that stretches over 70 miles in length and about 60 miles in width.\nThe Lake of the Woods covers an area of approximately 950,400 acres. Only 307,000 acres are in the United States.\nWater Levels\nLake of the Woods has experienced fluctuations in water levels throughout history, with the 1980s and 90s having less variation. The 1950s, 60s, and 70s had more variation in water level. \nThe increased variability since the year 2000 could signify a shift back to the water level variation of the past. This is due to a return to more typical weather patterns. It could also mark the beginning of a trend towards even more significant variability attributed to climate change.\nAverage water level\nThe average water level of the Lake of the Woods is 1,056 feet above sea level. However, the water level can vary depending on factors such as rainfall, snowmelt, evaporation, and dam operations.\nHistorical water level\nThe most significant high water period occurred in the mid-1950s, when it peaked at 1,064 feet above sea level. Just last year, the lake also reached the second-highest water level at 1,063 feet above sea level.\nGeology\nLake of the Woods naturally divides into two parts, the northern part and the southern part. Each has distinct geological features. The southern part of the lake is situated on the Laurentian strata. These old, stratified rocks are made up mostly of gneiss rocks that have been transformed by metamorphic activity. Additionally, beds of sand are found lining the lake shore. \nOn the other hand, the northern division is composed of softer rocks. These have been cut up into countless islands that belong to the Huronian geological period. The Huronian rocks are mineral-rich and contain various veins, including gold and other valuable minerals.\nThe Huronian strata, which overlays the Laurentian, is recognized as a shoreline formation that spreads out over long stretches. It has been highly deformed and disrupted. It is thought to have been impacted by the intrusion of large masses of granite rock. Additionally, it has been affected by the natural folding or crumpling of the earth’s surface, which is still occurring. The eastern section of Lake of the Woods, referred to as Whitefish Bay, is mainly located within the Laurentian basin. Its northern and eastern coastlines are composed of Huronian strata that contain significant mineral deposits.\nRunning through the Huronian strata between the western and northern peninsulas is Ptarmigan Bay. This strait is lengthy and narrow and ultimately connects to Shoal Lake. This lake is slightly elevated compared to the Lake of the Woods and is well-known for its abundant mineral reserves.\nFishing\nWalleyes are the most popular fish species in the lake and can be found in large numbers throughout the year.\n©FedBul/Shutterstock.com\nLake of the Woods offers a plethora of fishing opportunities, with many highly sought-after fish species living in its waters. This lake is so vast that exploring every corner of the fishable areas would be impossible in a single lifetime.\nAnglers in the Lake of the Woods can catch walleye, northern pike, muskie, sauger, perch, and several species of panfish. Walleyes are the most popular fish species in the lake and can be found in large numbers throughout the year. That said, the lake’s clear waters also provide excellent opportunities for muskie and northern pike fishing.\nFishing on Lake of the Woods is open year-round. Anglers can fish from a boat or from shore during the spring, fall, and summer, as well as on ice during the winter. Minnesota has frigid winters, and Lake of the Woods freezes over almost every year with a thick layer of ice. This ice is almost 2 feet thick in some parts!\nWalleye are most active during summer, while you are most likely to catch muskie and northern pike during the fall.\nThe lake is dotted with several resorts, lodges, and campsites that offer fishing packages and equipment rentals. Some popular resorts include Angle Outpost Resort, Ballard’s Resort, and River Bend Resort. Anglers can also hire local guides who are familiar with the lake’s fishing hotspots.\nBoating\nThe lake has exceptionally clear water, which makes for excellent snorkeling and scuba diving conditions.\n©iStock.com/milendm\nDuring the summer, visitors and locals are out on boats cruising the beautiful waters of Lake of the Woods. Some of the most popular boats on the lake are pontoon boats, canoes, and speedboats.\nThe lake has several marinas that offer boat rentals, boat launches, and other amenities. Some of the most popular marinas include the Rainy River Marina, Arnesen’s Rocky Point Resort, and Zippel Bay Resort. \nLake of the Woods is known for its many islands; boaters can explore them, alongside their beaches. Many of the islands are uninhabited and offer a unique wilderness experience. Boaters can also visit several historic sites on the lake, such as the Old Oak Island Lighthouse, which dates back to the early 1900s.\nBoating in Lake of the Woods is popular during the late spring, summer, and early fall. But, unfortunately, during most of the winter, the lake is frozen over, making boating dangerous and nearly impossible.\nThe lake has exceptionally clear water, which makes for excellent snorkeling and scuba diving conditions.\nCamping\nCamping is a wonderful way to escape the comforts of the city and appreciate what nature has to offer. Here are some of the camping options available in the region.\nPublic Campgrounds\nThe area has several public campgrounds, such as Zippel Bay State Park and Lake of the Woods County Park. \nThese campgrounds offer tent and RV camping, but there are also cabins for rent for those that want more comfort. The campsites are well equipped with picnic tables, fire pits, and restrooms with showers. These public campgrounds are often busy during the peak summer season, and reservations are recommended.\nPrivate Campgrounds\nThere are also several private campgrounds in the Lake of the Woods region. Private campgrounds are better suited for families and individuals who want a taste of nature with better facilities. Some extra facilities you can find at private campgrounds are swimming pools, playgrounds, and laundry facilities. Some private campgrounds in the region are Arnesen’s Rocky Point Resort , Borderview Lodge , and Sportsman’s Lodge.\nBackcountry Camping\nFor those who prefer a more rugged camping experience, backcountry camping is also available in the Lake of the Woods region. Visitors can camp on many of the lake’s islands or remote shorelines, but permits might be required.\nSnowmobiling\nLake of the woods is most popular as a summer destination. However, in the winter, the lake becomes a winter wonderland. Residents and visitors can enjoy many different winter activities.\nSnowmobiling, in particular, has gained popularity among many enthusiasts. Well-groomed trails wind through the forests and even over the frozen lake during the coldest months.\nThe snowmobile trails in this region are continuously maintained by experienced groomers. The network of trails is expansive, stretching from the Northwest Angle in the north to International Falls in the south and from Warroad in the west to Big Falls in the east.\nLake of the Woods is not one of the most popular snowmobiling destinations in the country, but it should be! The region boasts consistent snowfall, which lasts longer due to the cold weather. The area also offers breathtaking scenery, an array of resorts, and attractions such as the Igloo Bar. \nThe vast woods and expansive lake create a diverse and thrilling snowmobiling experience. Additionally, the strong snowmobile clubs in the area ensure the trails are maintained and safe for riders.\nUp Next:\nThe 15 Deepest Lakes in the United States\nThe 10 Most Alligator Infested Lakes in the United States\nThe Most Snake-Infested Lakes in Texas\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

The mountain’s nickname is “Home of the World’s Worst Weather.” The mountain is at the convergence of several major weather patterns, including the warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and the cool, dry air from Canada . This results in a constant battle between warm and cold air masses that can produce changing and dangerous weather.\nThe mountain’s nickname is “Home of the World’s Worst Weather.”\n©David Boutin/Shutterstock.com\nThe “Mount Washington Effect”\nOne of the most significant factors contributing to Mount Washington’s dangerous weather is the “Mount Washington Effect.” This phenomenon occurs when the prevailing westerly winds from the Atlantic Ocean collide with the mountain’s slopes, causing rapid changes in wind speed and temperature. The wind speeds on Mount Washington have been as high as 231 miles per hour . This is the highest wind speed ever observed by humans on the surface of the Earth. These extreme winds can cause temperatures to plummet, and wind chills can reach life-threatening levels in a matter of minutes.\nDeadly Accidents and Incidents on Mount Washington: A Result of Extreme Weather Conditions\nMount Washington is notorious for its extreme weather conditions . The weather led to many deadly accidents and incidents. The conditions of the mountain claimed the lives of many hikers, climbers, and adventurers over the years.\nAccording to a list compiled by New Hampshire Magazine, there have been 161 known deaths on Mount Washington since 1849. The causes of these deaths range from falls and hypothermia to heart attacks and avalanches. One common factor in many of these incidents is the unpredictable and harsh weather on the mountain.\nIn July 2023, two experienced climbers from Washington state fell to their deaths while climbing Mount Washington. The incident was because of extreme weather conditions that caused them to lose their footing and fall about 150 feet.\nAnother incident occurred in August 2022. This accident involved a 46-year-old Canadian man who collapsed and died while hiking with his son on Mount Washington because of severe weather conditions.\nSkiing Tuckerman Ravine on Mount Washington\nTuckerman Ravine is a natural amphitheater-shaped valley famous for its steep slopes and deep snowpack.\n©David Boutin/Shutterstock.com\nDespite its reputation as one of the deadliest mountains in the United States, Mount Washington is a popular destination for skiing and snowboarding enthusiasts. Tuckerman Ravine, on the eastern side of the mountain, is well-known as a premier backcountry skiing destination.\nTuckerman Ravine is a natural amphitheater-shaped valley famous for its steep slopes and deep snowpack.

Most often confused with the Siamese cat , the Oriental is similar but with a different coat color. If you’re looking into the breed, you’ll likely want to stay current on Oriental cat prices in 2023.\nBecoming an Oriental cat owner means being financially prepared to welcome your new furry friend into your home. Not only do you have to plan for the cost of purchasing the cat and the deposit, but you also need to calculate costs for vet bills, food, and other necessities for your cat. \nIf you don’t know where to start, don’t worry. Below, we’ve crafted a guide to help potential Oriental cat owners understand all the costs of owning one. So, let’s get into it!\nMost often confused with the Siamese cat, the Oriental is similar but with a different coat color.\n©iStock.com/chromatos\nHow Much Does an Oriental Kitten Cost?\nOriental cat prices will vary depending on where you get them. Kitten mills and adoption will be the cheapest method, but the breed isn’t generally easy to find with these options. In most cases, you’ll have to pay a breeder a premium price to get a purebred Oriental.\nThe price of an Oriental cat will depend on the breeder. Each breeder charges a different price depending on their breeding practices and care. On average, you can expect to pay anywhere from $600 to $3,000. \nAnother option is adopting an Oriental kitten, but it’s likely you won’t see this breed in any shelters. If you do, chances are you can either take them in for free or for a small adoption fee of $75 to $400. \nOriental cat prices will vary depending on where you get them.\n©iStock.com/User10095428_393\nOther Factors That Influence the Purchase Price of an Oriental Cat\nEven though Oriental cats have such varying looks, the coat color and pattern  generally  don’t impact the kitten’s price. Sometimes, a breeder upcharges Oriental cat prices for dibs on a certain kitten from the litter.  However,  in most cases, there are two reasons for upcharges, including good pedigree or champion bloodlines.\nChampion bloodline kittens are higher priced because one of the parents, grandparents, or even further up the line has earned a champion reward.\n©iStock.com/~UserGI15613517\nPedigree Oriental Cat Prices\nPedigree cats have two factors that increase their costs: breed status and popularity. When you buy a kitten from a purebred family line, you’re paying for the insurance that the cat has been the same breed for a few generations. Hence, the price for that guarantee will increase, and you can expect anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000. \nChampion Bloodline Oriental Cat Prices\nChampion bloodline kittens are higher priced because one of the parents, grandparents, or even further up the line has earned a champion reward. This reward is only given to cats with stunning genetic makeup for their breed. This means that the traits are outstanding and that this is the quality breeders should aim for. You can expect to pay anywhere from $2,000 to $3,500 for champion bloodlines or show kittens.\nCost of Vaccination and Other Medical Expenses for an Oriental Cat\nMedical Expense Cost Spay/Neuter $150 Vaccines $175 Microchipping $20 Dental $300 Preventative Medication (Heartworm, Fleas/Ticks) $140 Wellness Check $55\nPart of being a pet owner is ensuring you have enough saved to cover any necessary medical treatment in addition to Oriental cat prices. While these expenses are generally one-time purchases, you must budget this cost  before  getting your kitten. In total, you can expect to budget for a minimum of $840 , but prices will vary depending on your local vet.\nMandatory Vaccines\nOriental cats are the same as any other domestic cat breed and need a handful of required vaccines. That’s because mandatory shots are given from ages six to eight weeks and then will continue until they are sixteen weeks of age.\nThis includes the  feline panleukopenia virus  (FVR/FHV-1),  feline herpesvirus-1  (FCV), and  feline calicivirus vaccines  (FPV). First-year shots will range anywhere between $115 to $210, depending on the vet that you go to.\nWhen you do your kitten’s first general exam, you must pay $50. After that, you must do the first round of vaccines until the cat is 16 weeks of age. There may be exam fees and appointment fees added to the vaccine cost for your cat.\nMicrochipping\nAside from that, some owners microchip their cats to ensure they can still claim the cat is theirs if they get lost . However, it’s an optional medical cost, but it’s worth it if your cat gets loose. The average cost of microchipping is anywhere from $20 to $50.\nSkin & Fur Medication\nAdditionally, Oriental cats are prone to fleas , ticks, and mites. So, it’s good to put them on medication to prevent these parasites from preying on your cat. The monthly cost of these medications will vary, but most pet owners can expect to pay between $140 to $185.\nPeriodontal Disease Prevention\nLastly, the cat breed is known to be prone to periodontal disease. So, paying for annual dental work and checkups can be good at preventing the disease. This can cost up to $300, but you can get this covered by pet insurance .\nExtra Medical Expenses\nYou should also put at least $1,000 away for extra medical emergencies. Of course, you can also invest in pet health insurance . Still, it’s good to have an emergency fund for when a cat is injured or has an unexpected complication. Even if they are purebred, they may still have genetic health conditions that may pop up.\nCost of Food and Supplies for Oriental Cats\nCat Supplies Average Cost Cat Food $10-$50 Cat Food & Water Bowls $10-$30 Bed $30 Nail Clipper $10-$30 Litter Box $10-$200 Cat Litter $5-$60 Brush $5-$10 Toys $5-$100 Carrier $50-$100\nMost of these expenses are one-time costs besides food, litter, etc. As an Oriental cat owner, you must budget for one-time and recurring purchases. Of course, these expenses are only estimates, but you can expect to pay upwards of $610 or more. \nThe cost of having a cat will depend on a few factors. For example, you might spend extra if your kitten has a special health condition requiring certain foods. On the other hand, you may also need to buy toys if your cat is destructive.\nThis list also only covers the necessities. You should buy items like scratching poles, perches, and cat treats as a cat owner. This can help your cat feel less bored and enjoy their home more.\nHow Much Does It Cost to Insure an Oriental Cat?\nCat insurance costs vary depending on the cat’s age and the area insured. For example, an Oriental under six months in New York could cost anywhere from $24 to $52 for a basic plan. However, an older cat may cost anywhere from $50 to $100.\nInsurance is also based on coverage and preexisting health conditions. The best method for choosing pet insurance for your cat is to discuss it with your local veterinary offices. They can provide insurances that cover their services.\nCat insurance costs vary depending on the cat’s age and the area insured.\n©iStock.com/Leschenko\nDo You Need Cat Health Insurance?\nMost people think you can skip health insurance, but that’s not the case. Pet insurance is much cheaper than human insurance and covers a wide scope of veterinarian services. \nYour Oriental will be more prone to genetic health conditions than a mixed breed. If this happens, you can have a hefty vet bill of over $5,000. Most owners can’t afford this type of expense.\nSo, getting health insurance to help reduce the cost of other health expenses can be worth it in the long run. Health insurance can help hedge financial risks and reduce medical service costs over time. \nWhere Can You Get a Pet Insurance Quote?\nLike other types of insurance, you can get a pet insurance quote online. Even big-name sites like  Geico  and  Progressive  allow you to use their sites to find pet insurance quotes near you. You will need the following information:\nCat’s Age\nBreed Type\nZip Code\nTotal Oriental Cat Prices\nAs an estimated total, Oriental kittens may cost anywhere from $400 to $3,500.\n©Svyatoslav Balan/Shutterstock.com\nAs an estimated total, Oriental kittens may cost anywhere from $400 to $3,500. Additional medical fees will cost around $840 if you only count the minimum and don’t have an additional $1,000 for emergencies. Lastly, the cost of essentials adds up to $610.\nIn total, you should estimate a total of $1,850 to $5,000, along with an additional $1,000. Of course, this price can be lowered if you were to find a cat for adoption or if you were to go with only the essentials. However, if you’re considering owning an Oriental cat, you should expect to save at least in the middle of the two estimates.\nUp Next:\nMale vs Female Cats: 4 Key Differences Explained\nThe Top 10 Oldest Cats Ever!\n10 Types of Wild Cats\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

Despite these mountains being dangerous, plenty of climbers consider reaching the summit challenging. However, climbing the ten deadliest mountains on Earth requires training, experience, and dedication. \nThousands have attempted to climb the world’s deadliest mountains. While some of the mountains are easier to climb these days due to clear pathways, they still pose a risk of death. As of 2023, there have been 909 deaths collectively on the ten deadliest mountains.\nDiscover the 10 Deadliest Mountains\nDeadly mountains are those known as the  eight-thousanders . The term “eight-thousanders” refers to  The International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation  (UIAA) ‘s list of the 14 mountains with summits that are at least 26,247 feet (8,000 meters) above sea level. Many of these mountains in the Himalayas have over 3,411 named peaks. \nHarsh weather conditions, death zones, steep cliffs, and other obstacles make these the deadliest mountains. While we only list ten mountains, plenty of other peaks have claimed climbers’ lives. So, let’s take a look at the ten deadliest mountains.\n1. Mount Everest (310 deaths)\nThe most dangerous mountain to climb with over 300 deaths is Mount Everest.\n©Vixit/Shutterstock.com\nMount Everest is the world’s tallest mountain and is one of the most dangerous climbs. Located between Nepal and Tibet, it sits on the Himalayas. With its peak sitting at 29,029 ft above sea level, it’s safe to say that this is the most difficult to climb. \nClimbers who have challenged Mount Everest have found that extreme altitude and everchanging weather conditions make climbing the most dangerous. The temperatures can drop to -76 F with wind speeds reaching 200 mph.\nSince the first successful climb by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953, thousands of climbers have gathered to try their luck at reaching the summit. More than 310 people have died attempting to reach the mountain’s peak. Many of these deaths have been attributed to altitude sickness, falls, and avalanches. \n2. K2 (91 deaths)\nK2 is also known as Godwin-Austen and is the second-highest mountain in the world.\n©TripDeeDee Photo/Shutterstock.com\nThe second most dangerous mountain is also the second tallest. K2, also known as Godwin-Austen, is located between China and Pakistan. Its peak reaches an elevation of 28,251 feet above sea level, which is only an 800 feet difference from Mount Everest. \nHowever, K2 is very different, as the climate and topography are more unpredictable and rigid. Climbers have difficulty climbing K2 due to its steep ridges that lack aunty flatten edges. With Everest, at least there is a clear pathway on where to go. However, K2 is less climbed, and fewer people have mapped it out.\nCurrently, K2 has a recorded number of 91 deaths. Most of these are attributed to the  Death Zone , located 26,000 feet at the bottleneck of the mountain. The  Death Zone  describes a harsh environment where the body dies cell by cell due to oxygen deprivation.\n3. Nanga Parbat (85)\nThe ninth-highest mountain in the world with a known record of 85 deaths is Nanga Parbat.\n©iStock.com/Skazzjy\nNanga Parbat is less dangerous than the previous two mentioned and is the ninth tallest mountain in the world. It’s located in the Himalayas and is located between Pakistan and India. The peak of the mountain reaches 26,660 feet above sea level.\nWhile Nanga Parbat isn’t as challenging as some other mountains, it does pose its own challenges. Some include icy slopes, unpredictable weather conditions, and a high altitude. Temperature-wise, Nanga Parbat drops to -40 F and has high wind speeds of up to 200 mph. \nCurrently, there are 85 known fatalities reported on the mountain. However, a handful of people go missing without being reported. Many of these fatalities are due to avalanches.\n4. Manaslu (84)\nOne of the deadliest mountains on Earth is Manaslu.\n©iStock.com/Skazzjy\nManaslu, also known as the Mountain of the Spirit, falls just underneath Nanga Parbat’s height, making it the eighth-tallest mountain in the world. It’s also located in the Himalayas, but inside of Nepal. The peak sits at 26,781 feet above sea level. \nClimbers find that Manaslu is one of the more technical mountains to climb in the Himalayas. This is because you need experience with high-altitude mountaineering and technical terrain training. Manasly has icefalls, crevasses, and much steeper terrain, unlike other mountains. \nWith the climate dropping to -22 F and strong winds of up to 75 mph, it’s definitely less dangerous than the other mountains. Only 84 deaths have been reported, most of which are from falls and avalanches. Other deaths also were from altitude sickness and extreme weather conditions.\n5. Dhaulagiri I (82)\nDhaulagiri I has 82 reported deaths and is the seventh tallest mountain in the world.\n©Kiwisoul/Shutterstock.com\nKnown for being the seventh tallest mountain in the world, Dhaulagiri I is located in the Himalayas of Nepal. The peak of this mountain is located 26,795 feet above sea level, which is just under Manaslu.\nClimbers can expect the same difficulties as the other mountains but with more icefalls. The weather generally stays at -22 F with winds up to 62 mph. However, the mountain is prone to avalanches and lots of snowfall.\nCurrently, there are 82 reported fatalities, most of which are from avalanches. The mountain is also located in a remote location, which makes it harder to bring resources and get help. However, the climb is known for being worth it, as you get an amazing overlook at the surrounding mountain ranges and ice faces.\n6. Annapurna I (73)\nOne of the top deadliest mountains on Earth with 73 fatalities recorded is Annapurna I.\n©iStock.com/Andreas Felber\nAnnapurna I is the tenth-highest mountain in the world, located in the Annapurna mountain range of Gandaki Province of Nepal. The mountain’s peaks reach 26,545 feet above sea level, and it is known as one of the deadliest mountains to climb.\nFrom 2012 to 2022, Annapurna I held the highest fatality rate of the eight-thousander summits. Luckily, this rate is steadily decreasing thanks to a better understanding of pathways and resources needed to succeed on the climb. Only 73 fatalities have been recorded.\nThe mountain poses multiple threats to climbers, including avalanches, unpredictable weather, and steep climbing pathways. One pathway is located on the south face at 9,800 feet and is the most difficult path in the world. Trekkers also should be weary of snowstorms, as there was one in 2014 that claimed 43 lives.\n7. Kangchenjunga (58)\nMount Kanchenjunga is located in the Himalayan mountain range with a death toll of 58.\n©iStock.com/RNMitra\nKangchenjunga is the third tallest mountain in the world, with its summit being 28,169 feet above sea level. It’s located in the Himalayas in a place called the  Kangchenjunga Himal . The mountain lies between Nepal and India.\nWith unstable weather, avalanches, and high altitudes, Kangchenjunga is challenging for most climbers. Currently, there are recorded 58 fatalities. Most of these fatalities are from Yalung Kang and Camp IV, where many climbers have fallen due to the steep ledges.\n8. Cho Oyu (52)\nMount Cho Oyu from Kongma La pass is one of the easiest mountains to climb but has a death toll of 52.\n©iStock.com/DanielPrudek\nCho Oyu is located in a sub-section of Mahalangur Himalaya and stands between the China, Tibet, and Nepal borders. The summit sits at 26,864 feet, making Cho Oyu the sixth-highest mountain in the world. \nLuckily, Cho Oyu is the easiest of the eight-thousander mountains to climb. Fit climbers can trek to the summit even with low mountaineering skills. However, this doesn’t mean just anyone can do it.\nSadly, there are still 52 recorded fatalities on the mountain. Many of the deaths were due to various reasons. Recorded deaths include four members from an avalanche, two from exhaustion, and a few from falls. \n9. Makalu (40)\nMount Makalu makes the list of deadliest mountains on Earth with 40 deaths.\n©Daniel Prudek/Shutterstock.com\nMakalu is the fifth-highest mountain in the world, and the summit sits 27,825 feet above sea level. It’s located on the Mahalangur Himalayas and has a distinctive four-sided pyramid-shaped peak. \nThe mountain has taken the lives of 40 climbers to this day. A few were killed due to harsh weather conditions, such as a windslab avalanche. In contrast, others were from altitude sickness or unfortunate events.\n10. Gasherbrum I (34)\nGasherbrum mountain is the tenth deadliest mountain on Earth.\n©iStock.com/Skazzjy\nThe last deadly mountain on our list is the Gasherbrum I, also known as K5, the eleventh-highest mountain in the world. It’s located between the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan and Xinjiang in China. The summit reaches up to 26,510 feet above sea level.\nSo far, there have been 34 recorded deaths. Many of these deaths have been to falls or unpredictable storms. The death zone has also taken a few lives of unprepared climbers.\nUp Next:\n10 Important Mountains In The Bible\n8 Extinct Volcanoes from Across the World\n10 Awesome Mountains In Michigan\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

Harrison/Shutterstock.com\nTucked into the panoramic postcard views of Glacier National Park, Saint Mary Lake offers stunning beauty to all who will gather near.

At this time of year, the state literally bursts with color, revealing all of its splendor in hues of yellow, red, and orange. When is the greatest moment to view these stunning colors, this is the true query. Autumn lasts a long time, although the peak leaf season is only a few weeks long. \nThis is your opportunity to go on day vacations, weekend getaways, or extended trips in the woods if you’re planning any fall-themed adventures. Fortunately, this guide to fall foliage in Michigan will let you know precisely when to visit the Great Lakes State this year. \nCheck out when and how you can see the most vibrant fall foliage in your area, whether you’re a leaf-peeping addict or you’re just itching to don your favorite sweater and take a stroll in the woods. It’s an excellent resource for both residents and visitors. Considering taking a hiking trip? It’s ideal! Would you rather have a picnic beside the water? Let’s go! \nPictured Rocks National Lakeshore\nThe Miner’s Castle Trail and the Chapel Falls Loop, which both lead to well-known vantage spots over the lake, are the greatest hiking routes for seeing the spectacular scenery.\n©iStock.com/Kenneth_Keifer\nA section of Lake Superior’s shoreline under protection is called Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. The distinctive sandstone rock formations, gushing waterfalls , and breathtaking hiking trails are its most famous features. However, fall is arguably the greatest season to go because the vivid leaves bring out the red tones of the sandstone cliffs along the coast. In contrast to the enormous lake’s deep blue waters, the colors really pop.\nThe greatest ways to take in the fall foliage along the lakefront are to go for a scenic drive, sign up for a guided boat excursion, or go kayaking on your own. Famous sites including Chapel Rock, Lover’s Leap, and the Grand Island Lighthouse are viewable from the ocean. The Miner’s Castle Trail and the Chapel Falls Loop, which both lead to well-known vantage spots over the lake, are the greatest hiking routes for seeing the spectacular scenery.\nPorcupine Mountain Lake of the Clouds\nFall brings out the nearly overpowering beauty of the Porcupine Mountains’ true nature, particularly when seen from the completely accessible M-107 Scenic Overlook.\n©iStock.com/Melissa Kopka\nOne of the most popular photo locations in all of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is more attractive in the fall when the Porcupine Mountains’ surrounding wildness is ablaze with autumnal hues. \nAt any time of year, Lake of the Clouds is a breathtaking sight because of the stunning reflection of the sky in the crystal-clear water. Its natural setting, located in the Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park, is perfect for trekking and exploration. \nFall brings out the nearly overpowering beauty of the Porcupine Mountains’ true nature, particularly when seen from the completely accessible M-107 Scenic Overlook. When exploring the trails in these thick trees in the western upper peninsula, allow yourself enough time and don’t rush.\nThe return ride to Ontonagon, a historic town, takes a lovely half-hour. You may learn about the area and visit the lighthouse and county historical museum here. Relax at Peterson’s Cottages, a charming and immaculate location within a short stroll from Lake Superior. You can pick from cottages with one or two-bedrooms, chalets, or a three-bedroom house. It’s stunning in the fall, nestled in the woods.\nMackinac Island\nMackinac Island is a beautiful ancient town with cobblestone streets and impressive architecture, and you may frequently see horse-drawn carriages cruising through the streets.\n©iStock.com/Bywriter\nTo go to Mackinac Island, you’ll have to travel by ferry, but the trip is worthwhile in the autumn. This island retreat is halfway between upper and lower Michigan on Lake Huron. It’s a beautiful ancient town with cobblestone streets and impressive architecture, and you may frequently see horse-drawn carriages cruising through the streets.\nClimb the Bare Bluff Trail to get some exercise. Despite being one of the island’s hardest trails, it offers an excellent vantage of the surrounding fall foliage. Exploring the island on a rented bike while traveling the Mackinac Island Inner Loop is a fantastic additional option. \nAlong the eight-mile trip, you’ll journey through vibrant woodlands, beautiful beaches, and picture-perfect meadows. Great Lakes Air offers flights that last around 20 minutes that allow passengers to observe the fall leaves in Michigan for the brave.\nTahquamenon Falls\nThese are the biggest falls on this side of the Mississippi and must be included on any Michigan fall color tour.\n©iStock.com/DougLemke\nWhen you visit Tahquamenon Falls, you get two waterfalls in Michigan for the price of one: the Lower Falls, which has five cascading falls, and the Upper Falls, which is larger and more dramatic. \nTahquamenon State Park is loved throughout the year. We prefer going in autumn, there are fewer visitors and we can unwind while strolling along the paths and listening to the sound of water rushing. \nThese are the biggest falls on this side of the Mississippi and are a part of any Michigan fall color tour. They are among a mixture of vibrant hardwood and pine trees in the autumn.\nThis charming and spotless three-bedroom house in nearby Paradise, Michigan is where you should stay. You’ll discover a fireplace and activities for those cool autumn nights in this spotless, spacious, and open home with a full kitchen.\nSleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore\nOne of the best places to watch colors is along the Empire Bluff Trail, which provides access to a great vantage point with a lake view. \n©iStock.com/Gary Ennis\nSleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is a magnificent park with sand dunes, coastlines, and charming hiking paths that comes to life in the fall along the northern shores of Lake Michigan. One of the best places to watch colors is along the Empire Bluff Trail, which provides access to a great vantage point with a lake view. \nThe Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive is a wonderful place to spend some time inside the park’s limits. For the greatest lake and autumn foliage views, stop at overlooks 9 and 10. By the way, the lookouts are really stunning at sunset.\nTraverse City, which is nearby and has a ton of additional fall activities, is close by. Make time to enjoy some freshly brewed apple cider, visit a pumpkin patch, and indulge in some delicious spiced doughnuts. The renowned Cherry Republic gift shop, which sells Michigan beers, wines, and other delights, is located in the little port town of Glen Arbor, which is also close by.\nHonorable Mention: Alpena\nThe shoreline of Alpena is home to a variety of popular beaches and parks where you can sit quietly and admire Thunder Bay’s beauty as well as the small islands lining the horizon.\n©iStock.com/Roberto Galan\nExplore Alpena, MI if you want to go somewhere in Michigan that will totally amaze you. This ostensibly peaceful, historic town in northeast Michigan, on the shores of Lake Huron, is home to a wealth of things to do as well as some breathtaking natural surroundings. \nThe shoreline of Alpena is home to a variety of popular beaches and parks where you can sit quietly and admire Thunder Bay’s beauty as well as the small islands lining the horizon. There are seven Lake Huron lighthouses accessible, four state parks and recreation sites, and numerous local parks and recreation spaces, despite the appearance of the charming downtown business center. \nIf you want to shop during your trip, this is a charming area to meander through. The trails in Rockport Harbor State Park are one of the visitors’ favorite places to catch some gorgeous fall colors. Put your hiking boots on and start walking the paths.\nSleep at the Ramada by Wyndham, a setting that’s tidy and spacious that’s only a 10-minute stroll from the beach. With a sizable indoor pool, a game room area, and a fitness facility, this place is quite kid-friendly. Consider looking into the Holiday Inn Express and Suites as well. It has an indoor pool, is quite cozy, and offers daily breakfast.\nFall in Michigan\nWith little to no dryness in many portions of Michigan as autumn approaches, the length of the fall foliage is expected to be longer.\n©iStock.com/BobPalosaari\nFall color peak and brilliance predictions are seldom 100% accurate, but in some areas of Michigan, a fair estimate can be produced. With little to no dryness in many portions of Michigan as autumn approaches, the length of the fall foliage is expected to be longer. \nThe Thumb region is still experiencing low-end drought conditions due to the very dry summer, making Central Lower Michigan an outlier. In Michigan, temperatures in September (until the 20th) have been significantly higher than average, which often denotes a longer transition to peak color. For most of the rest of the season, lower temperatures that are almost below average are predicted, which will start the color shift.\nUp Next\nAnimals in Michigan\nTypes of Hawks In Michigan – With Pictures!\nDiscover the Deepest Lake in Michigan\nThe 14 Most Beautiful Michigan Lighthouses\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

With two levels to explore, there is so much to learn and experience. Let’s do a deep dive into what there is to know about this aquarium.\nUpper Level\nCheck out the jellyfish you can find at Ripley’s Aquarium of Myrtle Beach.\n©Nuttawut Uttamaharad/Shutterstock.com\nRio Amazon- Picture the lush vegetation of the rainforest: ferns pop up from the ground, circling avocado trees, and orchids bloom brightly. The rainforest is its unique habitat containing all types of plants and animals, many of which can only be found there. A few of the animals you can find among the displays include freshwater stingrays, poison dart frogs, armored catfish, arapaima , and piranhas. Each animal serves a purpose in this habitat, and you can discover what they are.\nFriendship Flats- If you have ever wanted to feel the silky flesh of a stingray , then you are in luck. There are stingrays gliding by in a shallow pool where you can caress them as they swim by. Remember to only touch their backs as their mouths are on their undersides. Any questions you have on rays can be answered in this exhibit.\nPlanet Jellies- Color-changing displays of jellyfish are situated for you to get the most out of your experience. The tanks are backlit and change colors, so get ready to be mesmerized. There are moon jellies, Japanese sea nettle, Atlantic sea nettle, upside-down jellyfish, and spotted lagoon jellies.\nPenguin Playhouse- Twenty-two named penguins make their home in the Penguin Playhouse. You can even meet the penguins on Ripley’s Aquarium website. African penguins live in the playhouse, but they also have a nursery for hatching their chick and a Penguin Encounter where you can experience a meet and greet.\nCargo Hold Gift Shop- Stow away inside the cargo hold and revel in the series of perfect tchotchkes and souvenirs from your trip to Ripley’s Aquarium of Myrtle Beach.

Divers can swim in close and even hand feed the sting rays, who revel in the attention people can give them.

In this aquarium, they are far more social.\nSystems Control- 1.4 million gallons of water are used to keep this aquarium going and the animals comfortable and happy. You can rest assured that there is nothing to worry about with over 1,000,000 feet of electrical wiring and a filtration system that can filter 11,664,000 gallons of water every 24 hours.\nOther Experiences to Enjoy\nVirtual Tours- You don’t have to worry about getting out of bed when you can take a virtual tour from the comfort of your home. A live educator will narrate pre-filmed footage of the aquarium and answer any questions you may have concerning the content.

You can touch a penguin and even help one paint a work of art.\nStingray Experience- Swim with a stingray and get to know them personally.

While it is restricted, locals recommend at least viewing the strange private island from afar. Some people have gotten lucky and gotten permission from the owner to explore the ‘lost’ island.\n9. Isle Royale\nA lighthouse overlooks the water at Isle Royale National Park.\n©Steven Schremp/Shutterstock.com\nIt would be impossible to make a list of the best islands in the Great Lakes without mentioning Isle Royale. This island is one of the most popular destinations in the Great Lakes because of its natural beauty and size. It is for adventurers and includes zip-lining courses, fishing piers, and breathtaking spots through a hiking trail. There are massive and vibrant pine trees that line the island, providing shade while backpacking and camping. Isle Royale is also part of the only national park in Michigan, the Isle Royale National Park .\n10. Devils Island\nNaturally eroded over time, the sea caves at Devils Island are stunning.\n©Gottography/Shutterstock.com\nDevils Island is a very popular and crowded island in Lake Superior. It is well-known for its tall lighthouse and interesting rock-cave formations on its northern shore. Kayakers and swimmers frequently visit these caves. The rocks are a sandy-red color, perfect for taking clear pictures. When the weather is rough, it can be dangerous to head into the caves as the thick waves crash inside. When visitors are tired from kayaking and swimming in the refreshing waters, they can also hike the many trails on the island. Some of these trails lead to an old engine house made of limestone and the lighthouse.\n11. Kelleys Island\nKelleys Island State Park in Lake Erie is highly forested.\n©Adelya Isyanamanova/Shutterstock.com\nFeeling bored at Kelleys Island is almost impossible. There is a lot to explore within the island and its many parks, gardens, and trails. Kelleys Island, in Lake Erie, is a 4.41 square mile lake and village. Most of the island is made up of limestone and dolomite from the Pleistocene era. While the island receives a lot of guests, the majority of the island is forested. Scuba diving is allowed, and you may even get lucky and see any of the 50 shipwrecks surrounding the island. Many fish and freshwater eel species have made homes underneath the shipwrecks.\n12. Pelee Island\nBeach walkers and fishers alike enjoy their time on Pelee Island.\nLast but not least, we have Pelee Island. This turquoise and vibrant forest green island is located in Lake Erie in Ontario, Canada. It is an agricultural island with dozens of different products like wheat, soy, grapes, and corn. This island has been occupied for at least 10,000 years, first by the indigenous people, but in the late 1700s, European settlers formed communities within the island. Now, in the 21st century, thousands of tourists visit Pelee Island yearly to enjoy the countless opportunities to swim, birdwatch, camp, hike, and enjoy annual festivals like the Annual Springsong Weekend.\nUp Next:\nHow Were the Great Lakes Formed and How Long Ago?\nThe 15 Biggest Fish in the Great Lakes\nWatch a Powerful Storm Pound Lake Superior and the Great Lakes\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

There are, however, countless more locations that are equally rich in history. For example, Pennsylvania’s longest tunnel has been around for decades, but it didn’t become the state’s longest tunnel until another popular tunnel was closed for good.\nWhich Tunnel In Pennsylvania Has The Longest Length Today?\nThe Allegheny Mountain Tunnel on the Pennsylvania Turnpike is the longest tunnel in use in the state.\n©ShawnGPhotos/Shutterstock.com\nThe Pennsylvania Turnpike’s Allegheny Mountain Tunnel is the state’s longest operational tunnel. At 1.15 miles in length, this tunnel is the longest in operation in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Turnpike passes through the Allegheny Mountains via a tunnel in the mountains. Interstates 70 and 76 each connect to the Turnpike.\nThe New Jersey Turnpike also includes the Tuscarora Mountain, Kittatinny Mountain, and Blue Mountain tunnels. The cheapest alternative was to have a second tube bored for each. Only four of the original tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike are still in use today , and two of those are the Allegheny Tunnels.\nAllegheny Mountain Tunnel: A Chronology\nThe tunnel, which passes through the Allegheny Mountains, first opened to the public in 1939. At one time, the tunnel served both eastbound and westbound travelers. Decades later in 1965, a new eastbound tunnel opened, providing for better traffic flow, and the original tunnel became dedicated to westbound traffic only.\nContrary to popular belief, the Allegheny Tunnels weren’t the first tunnels to bear the name “Allegheny.” The first tunnel, intended for use by railways, began construction towards the end of the 19th century but was never completed. Because of safety concerns, this tunnel was never put to use.\nThe 1980s was the last time the existing tunnels were updated. Ten years later, an inspection by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission found that the tunnels needed to be renovated once more. Nonetheless, as of the year 2020, investigations are still being conducted to ascertain the best manner to carry out the necessary renovations.\nThe Tunnel Will Be Renovated\nState officials have been trying to replace the tunnel since the turn of the millennium because of its advanced age. Major repairs to the tunnels are planned for the long term, however, this will significantly disrupt traffic. Officials were forced to construct a second tunnel due to the severe congestion. Closing one tube and directing all traffic via the other is not a viable option under current conditions. Currently, 11 million automobiles use it each year.\nIn 2020, after considering a number of design options, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission settled on a new road-only alignment to the south of the tunnels because it will cause less environmental damage and cost $332 million less than building a replacement tunnel. Many snaky bends to the east of the tunnel will be updated to modern standards as part of the project. Just the planning and design phases of the project have been funded.\nWith the employment of a firm in early 2023 to design a 3.8-mile road around the tunnel, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission made significant progress in its decades-long campaign to demolish the Allegheny Tunnel in Somerset County. The half-billion-dollar project might take up to 10 years to plan and construct, and there are still significant obstacles to overcome. There is significant public and political opposition to the development.\nA Technological Miracle: The Allegheny Mountain Tunnel\nThe construction of the tunnel through the Allegheny Mountains was hailed as a technological feat at the time. While driving through it, your field of view will be severely restricted. A tunnel lacks any aesthetic value as a building structure. These buildings are short and stark in appearance because they were designed with 55 mph tractor-trailer traffic in mind.\nArt, nevertheless, exists. The genius of physics and engineering is on display here, as the roof is able to support the weight of an entire mountain. A tunnel is fundamentally not a cave but rather a physical promise of warmth and light at the other end.\nFor a brief second, especially during rush hour, the light from both ends of the Allegheny Tunnels goes out, leaving just the pulsating orange glow of the fluorescent lights to illuminate the roads.\nAt some point in the center of these tunnels, motorists cross a line, thereby teleporting them to another location . The static of once-familiar radio stations gives way to the crackle of new transmissions as the world behind fades away and the world ahead begins to unfold.\nCan You Name The State Of Pennsylvania’s Longest Tunnel Ever?\nThe Sideling Hill Tunnel was the longest tunnel in Pennsylvania at 1.28 miles (6,782 feet (2,067 m), but it was shut down in 1968. After two major realignment projects, the Sideling Hill Tunnel was one of three original tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike to be abandoned. The other two are Rays Hill Tunnel, which is close by, and Laurel Hill Tunnel, which is to the west. Instead of boring a second tube to expand the Turnpike to four lanes, it was cheaper to simply realign it.\nThe original Sideling Hill Tunnel on the Pennsylvania Turnpike was the longest of its kind. There are now two tunnels on the Pike2Bike Trail: Ray’s Hill and Sideling Hill. The two passageways and the highway are collectively known as the Disused Pennsylvania Turnpike.\nUp Next:\nThe 15 Deepest Lakes in the United States\nThe 6 Worst Tornadoes in the United States and the Destruction They Caused\nMeet the 10 Largest Land Owners in Montana\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

The famous and towering mountain ranges in the western United States, the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada, are geological infants compared to the country’s oldest mountains. We have compiled details and ranked the oldest mountain ranges in the United States by age. Let’s take a look now. \nRanked #6: Black Hills at 70 Million Years Old\nThe Black Hills is a solitary mountain range in South Dakota and Wyoming.\n©iStock.com/John_Brueske\nThe Black Hills is a solitary mountain range in South Dakota and Wyoming. The highest peak is over 7,000 feet in elevation, though peaks were up to 15,000 feet tall millions of years ago. Humans have lived there for over 10,000 years, and white settlers flooded the area in a gold rush during the 19th century.\nAn uplift occurred around the Cretaceous and Paleogene boundary, which created these hills. The core of these hills is made of rock that was created over two billion years ago.\nThe Lakota name for the mountains is Paha Sapa, meaning “black hills.” This refers to the black silhouettes of the mountains on the horizon when looking at the mountains from a distance.\nThe Black Hills spruce is an endemic tree. Wildlife includes American bison, bighorn sheep, prairie dogs, northern flying squirrels, and ruffed grouse. The white-winged junco is endemic to the area.\nMount Rushmore is a famous tourist stop in the region. The faces of presidents Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington are carved into the rock of Mount Rushmore.\nRanked #5: Arbuckle Mountains at 300 Million Years Old\nThe Arbuckle Mountains lie between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians.\n©iStock.com/TrongNguyen\nBetween the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians lies the Arbuckle Mountains in Oklahoma. They are the oldest geological development located between these two major ranges.\nThe core of this mountain range consists of materials that came into being over 1.4 billion years ago. The top layer was created over 290 million years ago as sediment from a now-extinct ocean built up over time.\nThere is an important aquifer beneath these mountains called the Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer. Water seepage through thick limestone has created a cave network. The area has fault lines, including the North Sulphur and South Sulphur faults.\nThe highest peak is a little over 1,400 feet above sea level, though this looks truncated as the surrounding land is also elevated. This is why they’re sometimes called hills, even though they’re technically tiny mountains.\nThey were much larger in the past, but they’ve eroded over time. This erosion makes these mountains more of a plateau with lots of ridges.\nRanked #4: Ouachita Mountains at 300 Million Years Old\nThe name Ouachita refers back to the original indigenous people of the region.\n©Tammo2011 / CC0 1.0 – License\nLocated in southeast Oklahoma, the Ouachita Mountains are the leftovers of a much larger mountain range that no longer exists. This larger extinct range probably extended from Canada to Texas. The Ozark Plateaus and the Ouachitas make up the U.S. Interior Highlands.\nThere is a noticeable endemic flora population. Some local plants include Ouachita bluet, Browne’s waterleaf, Arkansas gayfeather, Ouachita Mountain goldenrod, narrow-leaf ironweed, and Palmer’s cornsalad.\nThe name Ouachita refers back to the original indigenous people of the region. When the French colonialists found these mountains, they latinized the indigenous word into what it is today.\nRanked #3: Presidential Range at 350 Million Years Old\nMount Washington is in the Presidential Range.\n©iStock.com/Gerald G Gantar\nMost of the Appalachian Mountains are temperate, though a few exceptions exist. One is Mount Washington in the Presidential Range, and that and surrounding peaks provide over 7.5 square miles of the area above the timberline .\nMount Washington sometimes experiences winds above 200 miles per hour. It’s also freezing and has never been over 71 degrees Fahrenheit since modern record-keeping began.\nThe Presidential Range is part of the White Mountains, and the White Mountains occupy a large swath of New Hampshire and a bit of Maine. The range is known for being rugged and has some of the most difficult terrain encountered on the Appalachian Trail.\nRanked #2: Appalachian Mountains at 480 Million Years Old\nThe Appalachian Mountains are a mountain range in the eastern United States and Canada.\n©Margaret.Wiktor/Shutterstock.com\nThe Appalachian Mountains are a mountain range in the eastern United States and Canada. These mountains extend from Alabama to Newfoundland.\nThey came into existence around 100 million years before terrestrial animals evolved. They also existed before the Atlantic Ocean.\nFurthermore, they’re decreasing in size because the tectonics that created them are no longer near them. They were once very tall, but erosion has reduced their height.\nThis mountain range has three major sections: southern, central, and northern. The Appalachians are the rough divide between the eastern United States and the Midwest. The Blue Ridge Mountains are one of the oldest parts of the Appalachians and may be over a billion years old.\nThere are various animals found at different spots in these mountains. Some notable creatures are black bears, spring peepers, eastern copperheads, timber rattlesnakes, North American cougars, and eastern wolves.\nIn the spring, wildflowers draw tourists to the Appalachians. By April, flowers like laurels, azaleas, and rhododendrons begin blooming in the south of the range. This trend sweeps upward as spring progresses.\nBecause of the isolation of some highlands in the Appalachian Mountains, a distinct culture developed. Folklore and music are examples of the kind of unique developments that took place in these mountain communities.\nRanked #1: Uwharrie Mountains at 500 Million Years Old\nThe Uwharrie Mountains were originally 20,000 feet tall.\n©iStock.com/digidreamgrafix\nLocated in North Carolina, these mountains are so old that their tallest peak is only 1,100 feet. Originally, they were 20,000 feet tall. They were also originally on the coast and are now 150 miles inland.\nHistorically, these mountains were completely cleared for farming and wood harvesting. In 1961, President Kennedy designated this range as a national forest, and native plant life is again present.\nThe North Carolina Zoo is in the Uwharrie region and is one of two state-supported zoos in the USA. It was the first of the two state-sponsored zoos in the United States to be established.\nUp Next:\n10 Important Mountains In The Bible\n10 Awesome Mountains In Michigan\n8 Extinct Volcanoes from Across the World\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

Yes, they do go on water but they also go on snow, over rocks, across ground and through forests. Then they go down waterfalls and eventually hit serene lakes . Watching a video of this spectacular descent will leave you breathless and in awe of the skill and courage of the kayaker.\nThrilling Kayak Descent on Snow, Land and Water\nThis film records Spanish kayaker Aniol Serrasolses as he kayaks from Chile’s snowy volcano summit in the Araucanía region along a 25-meter route that takes him through open ground and forests. It’s part of the Red Bull series and has already been viewed over a million times. It’s the ultimate natural obstacle course.\nAniol is a kayaker adventurer from the Catalonia region of Spain. He has made a big impact in the kayaking world with his achievements and extreme kayak adventures. In this film we see him carry out the world’s first double kickflip on a kayak. It’s absolutely spectacular!\nWhen he was interviewed about his journey, he commented that he wanted to combine the elements of earth, air, water and fire. At times he reaches speeds of 60 mph and things do go wrong. He is thrown out of the kayak and onto the snow at one point but he simply brushes himself off and gets back in.\nIf you want to combine kayaking with snow boarding you could try snow kayaking!\n©Maridav/Shutterstock.com\nSpectacular Environment in Chile\nChile has a range of spectacular locations. This particular footage was filmed in the Araucanía region which is in the south of the country. It has plenty of fertile valleys, lakes and snowy mountains. It is also well known for its adventure sports industry.\nSnow kayaking is for people who don’t want to put their kayaks away for the winter and put on their skis. They just take their kayak out onto the snow!\nIt’s like a combination of kayaking, snowboarding and speed riding and appeals most to people who are fans of extreme sports. In addition to the speed and the potential dangers, it also gets pretty cold so it is vital to use the correct kit. It has become increasingly popular and there are international competitions where these amazing athletes can show off their skills!\nUp Next:\n10 Important Mountains In The Bible\n8 Extinct Volcanoes from Across the World\n10 Awesome Mountains In Michigan\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

One of the most unique things these limbless animals can do is climb walls! \nA video surfaced on Youtube of a yellow rat snake doing just that! It’s leaving viewers in awe as it appears like some sort of optical illusion. So, how on earth is this happening? Snakes don’t have hands, feet, claws, or toe pads that stick to surfaces to help them climb. They can also swim, dig, glide, and even float. \nSnakes use the whole length of their tubular bodies to bend and flex while climbing. Although their glossy bellies appear to be unfit for climbing, they easily glide over tree bark and walls! If they had been rough, the movement of the reptiles would have been slowed by friction. \nTree trunks can be smooth or textured. Certain snakes can’t cling to smooth wall surfaces or tree trunks. Around the United States, experienced tree climbers like western rat snakes stay away from smooth-barked trees.\nYet, compared to mountains and woods, man-made walls are more challenging to scale. They have no branches or other bulges to grab onto and are fully upright. Depending on the material of the wall, a snake may or may not be able to scale it. \nA snake can scale a wall if it has ridges or grooves in it. Snakes are skilled at climbing stone and brick walls , for instance. To stay put, they cling to the spaces between the bricks.\nYellow Rat Snakes\nAccording to our snake expert, the serpent in the video we linked below is a yellow rat snake. The yellow rat snake , an adult measures four feet on average. They can occasionally grow to seven feet in length. \nYellow rat snake looking directly into the camera.\n©Patrick K. Campbell/Shutterstock.com\nIt is a semi-arboreal snake with a range of colors that is usually feisty but not venomous. There are often four distinct dark stripes on this species. When alarmed, all rat snakes will hiss and frequently vibrate their tails. \nWhen this creature is in dried grass or leaves, it will produce a whirring sound resembling a rattlesnake . Yellow rat snakes spend a lot of time in rodent burrows when underground. Yellow rat snakes, which are truly arboreal, frequently climb trees to catch and eat birds and their nests. \nThe snake has been observed climbing as high as 60 feet to look for prey in trees. Climbing a wall, like in the video below, is no difficult feat for this slithering serpent. \ndetails.\nUp Next:\nThe Biggest Snake Ever Found in Texas\nThe Largest King Cobra in the World\nWatch a Battle Between a Copperhead vs. Kingsnake in Alabama Woods\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

They are omnivores that hunt for meat and also eat berries and vegetation, but what colors can foxes be?\nGood question!\nIt depends on their environment, the season, and the effects of selective human breeding.\nFoxes are very successful animals that live on most of the world’s continents.\n©Giedriius/Shutterstock.com\nWhat is a Fox?\nBefore we dive in, let’s take a quick look at what a fox is, because this will help us understand why there is a color range.  \nFoxes are members of the Canidae family. They are smaller than wolves with pointed snouts, upright ears, and fantastically bushy tails. Males are called dogs or tods, females are vixens, and babies are cubs or kits. There are 47 species worldwide and four species live in North America. They are the red fox, gray fox , arctic fox, and kit fox.\nWhen foxes hunt, they use stealth, sneaking up on their victim before pouncing on it. Foxes are versatile animals that live in forests, mountains, deserts, tundra, and even urban areas. They survive by changing their habits and behavior to fit in.\nFoxes are versatile animals that live in forests, mountains, deserts, tundra, and even urban areas.\n©Parque Tepuhueico / CC BY-SA 4.0 – License\nWhat Color Can Foxes Be?\nFox colors range from red, gray, tan, white, black, and a combination of all these colors.\nWhy Are Foxes Different Colors?\nThere are several reasons why foxes are not all the same color:\nWhite foxes live in cold regions such as arctic tundras.\n©bhavdip12/Shutterstock.com\nDifferent Species\nDifferent species are different colors. For example, a red fox is a different species from a gray fox, so there are fur color differences.\nIn addition, fox pelts are bred for human consumption on fur farms, so human influence has created certain colored foxes for profit.\nCamouflage\nWild foxes are secretive animals that avoid human contact and they are also prey to mountain lions, lynxes, mountain eagles, bears, wolves, and coyotes. Fur color that matches the environment helps them hide.\nFoxes are also adept hunters, that blend into their environment to hunt hares , voles, rodents, birds, and aquatic animals. A coat that matches their surrounding helps them eat regularly.\nSeasonal Changes\nFoxes change color depending on the season! This relates to camouflage. For example, arctic foxes turn white to match winter snowfall, but they are gray in summer to match the multi-hued tundras.\nEvery fox is different! Even the same species have color variations. Like our domestic cats and dogs, fur markings vary and no two individuals are the same.\nLet’s take a look at the different fox fur colors.\nDifferent Colors\nEvery fox is different! Even the same species have color variations.\n©iStock.com/BlueBarronPhoto\nRed\nRed foxes are the largest and most common fox species on the planet. They inhabit all US states including Alaska.\nThese clever canines are not red, but various shades of orange, gold, and brown with a white belly and white-tipped tail. Their legs are most often black and in winter, their fur turns darker brown.\nBut wait!\nNot all red foxes are orange! Here are some of the species variations:\nSilver and Black\nA silver and black red fox is called a ‘color morph’. It’s a red fox in species, but not in color! Silver and black red foxes usually have silver upper coats, black legs and black ears, and a white-tipped tail. This makes them look like small wolves.\nCross Color\nRed foxes that are cross colored have a reddish torso, with dark legs, a white, black, and silver face with red ears. Their tails are much fluffier than red-colored red foxes.\nOften, a black line runs from their neck to the tail base and across the shoulders, hence the name “cross fox.” They are a cross between a red fox and a red fox with a silver and black color morph.\nExperts think cross foxes make up around 25-30% of the red fox species in North America.\nWhite and Light Brown\nA white and light brown fox is called a fire and ice fox. It’s a red fox with a light beige and red coat merging into a white neck. Their ears and feet are dark gray and they may have green or yellow eyes. It’s quite rare, and this color is usually a result of human breeding for the pet or pelt trade.\nChampagne\nBred from red fox mutations, champagne foxes are a result of human selective breeding in Quebec during the 1970s. These very rare foxes are pink and golden shades with white-tipped tails, pale blue eyes, and pink noses.\nMarbled\nMarbled foxes came about through human selective breeding back in the 1940s. They are a very rare type of red fox in the wild but are often bred and raised on fur farms for their pelts.  \nGray\nThe common gray fox is a peppery mix of gray, white, and black with a pale or rusty orange flush on their chests and head. Like red foxes, their underbellies are white but their tail tips are black. Many gray foxes have a black stripe running along their spine.\nThere are 16 recognized subspecies of gray foxes in North America and they tend to have slightly different white, black, gray, ash, and silvery color combinations.  \nGray fox numbers are dwindling in the US due to deforestation, building, and farming clearance.\nTan\nTan-colored foxes reside in desert environments, blending into sand, rocks, and sun/shade variations. As a result, their coats range from beautiful cream to rich tan with a peppery dash of gray or silver. A tan fox will usually have black markings on its face and a white underbelly. In the US, kit foxes are tan.\nAlgerian fennec foxes have tan coloration with adorably large white ears. These miniature tan foxes are the national symbol of Algeria and popular exotic pets.\nWhite\nWhite foxes live in cold regions such as arctic tundras. There are two natural color morphs.\nThe white Arctic fox is not always white! In spring and summer, its coat is a dark brown and gray mixture, then as the season changes to winter, it grows a white coat to match the snow.  \nThe blue arctic fox morph isn’t bright blue, it’s more charcoal slate-blue in the winter, only lightening up a little for the winter months. These color morphs tend to hunt in areas with less snowfall.\nOn occasion red, gray, and desert fox species are born white. This is a result of albinism. These white foxes lack melanin that creates color, so they have white coats with pink eyes and pink noses. This coloration is very rare, and often a hindrance to survival as it’s easier for prey and predators to spot them.\nBlack\nThe rarest fox color is black. They are so rare that experts think they only make up 0.1% of the North American fox population. Black foxes are usually red fox species with a condition called melanistic coloring.\nWhat Color Are Fox Cubs?\nFox cubs (or kits as they are also called) are born dark brown.\n©iStock.com/slowmotiongli\nFox cubs (or kits as they are also called) are born dark brown and develop red, tan, gray, or white fur as they mature depending on their species.\nThey are heavily predated and spend most of their time in the den, learning how to hide and hunt before venturing out with their mother fox.\nAre Male and Female Foxes Different Colors?\nMale and female foxes of the same species are the same general color, but there can be lots of variation. For example, a male red fox may have deeper red shades than his vixen mate .\nDo Blue Foxes Exist?\nBecause fox fur is valuable (unfortunately some people still like to wear it) humans have bred foxes to create some stunning color variations.\nOne of these variations is the blue frost fox (sometimes called Indigo fox) created by crossing a silver color fox with a blue Arctic fox. They have white-tipped tails, black noses, and yellow eyes. They are beautiful but suffer from poor health due to commercial interbreeding.\nAs we’ve seen, fox color varies with their environment, the season, and sometimes pure luck\n©Cecilie Bergan Stuedal/Shutterstock.com\nWhat Color Are Foxes in North America?\nFoxes are cunning, clever canines that come in many different shapes and sizes. In the States, there are four species. The orange-red red fox, the black and white peppered gray fox, the golden-tan kit fox, and the gray or white arctic fox. The most common species is the red fox followed by the gray fox.\nAs we’ve seen, fox color varies with their environment, the season, and sometimes pure luck, but the most common foxes spotted by humans are orange-red with black legs and a white-tipped tail.\nUp Next:\nFox vs Coyote – The 5 Key Differences\nWhy Do Foxes Scream At Night?\nWhat Do Red Foxes Eat? 7 Types of Food They Love!\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

We’re going to answer the question, “What is the continental divide and why is it important?” We’ll examine how continental divides are made, what they do, and how they affect people and animals.\nContinental divides are mountainous geographical features in the landscape that separate rainfall and drain it into different areas.\n©iStock.com/SeanXu\nWhat Is A Continental Divide?\nContinental divides are mountainous geographical features in the landscape that separate rainfall and drain it into different areas.\nThey are large boundaries that dictate what landmass, rivers, oceans , and in some cases, endorheic basins with no outlets to an ocean, rain or snow melt runs into.\nImagine a mountain range like the Rockies. When it rains overhead, raindrops land on either side of the highest peaks and run downhill in opposite directions. This establishes the flow of rivers and means those rainstorm droplets end up in very different places.  \nSimply put, a continental divide is a water drainage divider.\nContinental divides are mountainous geographical features in the landscape that separate rainfall.\n©Nicholas Courtney/Shutterstock.com\nAmerica’s Continental Divide\nAmerica has six continental divides dictating where rainfall ends up, but when people say “the continental divide” they usually mean The Great Continental Divide, sometimes shortened to The Great Divide.\nIt runs for the most part, along the Rocky Mountains’ highest ridge from Cape Prince of Wales on the Bering Sea coast of Alaska, to the Strait of Magellan, in South America’s Andes.\nIt’s considered the greatest because it’s the longest and directs water into either the Atlantic or the Pacific ocean.\nRain that falls on the east of the continental divide eventually joins the Atlantic Ocean. It enters the South Platte River and runs through the Mississippi river, New Orleans, and into the Gulf of Mexico.\nRain falling on the western side runs in the opposite direction to the Pacific Ocean via the Colorado River. It travels through Utah, the Hoover Dam, and Las Vegas.\nIn some cases, water will run into an endorheic basin like Utah’s Great Salt Lake or Oregon’s Crater Lake that has no ocean outlets.\nThe Great Divide runs all the way from Alaska through Mexico and into South America, diverting a massive amount of rainfall and water resources. It is a huge geological feature. The highest point is Colorado’s Gray’s Peak with an elevation of 14,270 feet.\nAcoma and Zuni tribes built stone bridges and cairns which still stand on the Great Divide Trail.\n©Grenierb/Shutterstock.com\nCentral and South America\nIn Central America , the continental divide runs alongside the Sierra Madre mountain system and the Panama Canal cuts through it. Continuing on to South America , the continental divide runs along the Andes mountain chain. Water falling to the west of the Andes reaches the Pacific ocean and to the east, it finishes in the Atlantic ocean .\nHow Was It Made?\nThe Earth’s crust is formed of seven continental plates that move back and forth.\n©MattMakesPhotos/Shutterstock.com\nThe Earth’s crust is formed of seven continental plates that move back and forth. When they rub against each another they cause earthquakes.\nIn the distant past, continental plates collided with enormous force, and when a small tectonic plate collided with the North American plate 70 million years ago, it was subducted (pulled beneath). This motion pushed up a towering mountain range we know today as the Great Continental Divide.\nIt’s staggering to think the Earth’s activity so many millions of years ago has such a profound effect on today’s ecosystems, weather patterns, droughts, and the crop harvest we rely on.\nWhy is it so Far West?\nThe continental divide known as The Great Divide is way off center, to the west of the continent. It wasn’t designed by humans, it’s an accident of geography that occurred when the world was formed.\nWhen the United States was colonized by Europeans in the 17 th and 18 th centuries, the Great Divide was a marker for the unknown that lay ‘out west’, and it was a barrier to westward expansion . Lewis and Clark’s expedition crossed it at the Lehmi Pass in Montana, and settlers crossed through the South Pass in Wyoming.\nThousands of years before settlers arrived, the continental divide was inhabited by indigenous people including the Acoma and Zuni tribes whose stone bridges and cairns still stand on the Great Divide Trail. The highest peaks were sacred to the Blackfeet Nation’s creation stories. They called the peaks “mistakis, the backbone of the world”.\nThe United States’ Continental Divides\nThe continental divide between the European and North American continental plate in Iceland.\n©Benedikt Juerges/Shutterstock.com\nThe North American continent contains six mountaintop divides that send water to the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Arctic oceans, or into landlocked lakes or salt flats.\nThese are the divides most experts agree on:\nLaurentian/ Northern\nArctic\nSt Lawrence\nEastern\nGreat Basin\nThe Great Continental Divide and Laurentian divide converge at Glacier Park’s Triple Divide Peak in Montana. It’s a popular tourist spot and so named because from here, water enters three oceans. The Pacific, the Atlantic, and the Arctic Oceans. Experts consider it North America’s ‘hydrological apex’.\nWhy the Continental Divide is Important\nContinental divides are important because they determine where, and to whom, fresh water goes. Every living thing on our planet needs water to survive.\nGroundwater creates weather patterns, rivers, and streams that irrigate crops and provide water for many habitat regions as it makes its way to the oceans.\nIt has also created differing cultures and ways of life due to the water resources it provides. Wide open farms that require dams and irrigation systems would look very different if shifted.\nIf the divide was just a few miles further to the east or west, it would significantly change the U.S. topography, weather, and landmass use as we know it.\nWhat Animals live near the Continental Divide in North America?\nAlways carry bear spray on the Great Divide Trail and keep your eyes peeled.\n©Piotr Krzeslak/Shutterstock.com\nThe Great Divide Trail runs along the continental divide and it’s packed with interesting, unusual, and sometimes dangerous animals because the habitats are so varied. The trail is one of the country’s most ecologically diverse. It runs for 3,100 miles through five western states!\nHabitats include tundra, coniferous forests, subalpine meadows, craggy snow-covered peaks, grassland , sagebrush, and many miles of rivers and streams all fed by rain falling east or west from the very tip of the continental divide.\nIt is bear country with both grizzly and black bears in residence. Always carry bear spray on the Great Divide Trail and keep your eyes peeled. Mountain lions are a rare sight, but they do live in the Rockies, as do wolves.\nBeavers, yellow-bellied marmots, coyotes, snowshoe hares, pika rodents, boreal toads, and bats have all made it their home, and hikers often spot lots of ungulate species (these are hoofed animals) including deer, elk, bighorn sheep, moose and varieties of cattle.\nBald eagles soar over the mountain tops, white-tailed ptarmigan, mountain chickadee, western tanager, and many species of owls and woodpeckers are loved by birdwatchers there.\n The continental divide is a rich habitat for all species of animals.  \nDoes Europe Have a Continental Divide?\nA marker on Rhine Main Danube canal at the European Continental Divide in Germany.\n©Steve Heap/Shutterstock.com\nYes, every continent has continental divides except Antarctica, which doesn’t receive enough rainfall to flow from peaks into drainage basins.\nEurope is surrounded by many seas, has many mountain ranges, and therefore many continental divides, but the main one experts agree on (and not all agree!) is the European watershed that separates the northeast bodies of water from the southwest bodies. The northwest bodies are:\nAtlantic Ocean\nNorth Sea\nBaltic Sea\nArctic Sea\nThe southern bodies are:\nMediterranean Sea\nAdriatic Sea\nAegean Sea\nBlack Sea\nCaspian Sea\nThe Political Continental Divide\nSome commentators refer to the way states tend to regularly vote either democratic or republican as a continental divide. In some cases it refers to the social differences between American and Canadians.\nWhat Is The Continental Divide? Why Is It Important?\nLet’s recap.\nThe Great Continental Divide is a mountain range created millions of year ago by the Earth’s continental plate activity. It runs from Alaska to the tip of South America and dictates whether rainfall runs to the Pacific or Atlantic oceans.\nIt’s important because it divides water resources. In turn, this creates ecological habitats and weather patterns, so the continental divide dictates where we can successfully grow crops and thrive.\nIn the past, the continental divide was part of the indigenous nation’s creation mythology and in the settler period, it was a massive physical barrier to westward expansion.\nUp Next:\n10 Important Mountains In The Bible\n10 Awesome Mountains In Michigan\n8 Extinct Volcanoes from Across the World\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

They do huge economic and ecological damage, carry a lot of different diseases, and can be aggressive toward people and domestic animals. States are using a variety of methods to try to get them under control, including hunting, trapping, poisoning, and sterilization. Humanely decreasing their numbers is vital to preserving the diversity of the natural environment as well as valuable farmland and other private property. Find out in this article where they came from and what is the wild boar population by state.\nWild boars are an invasive species found in most U.S. states. They do tremendous damage to the natural environment and to agricultural land.\n©iStock.com/chingkai huang\nKey Points:\nWild hogs are also known as feral hogs, wild or feral pigs, razorbacks, or wild boars.\nThey are escaped domestic pigs and their descendants that live and breed in the wild.\nWild hogs in may number 9 million in the U.S. and have been spotted in 40 states.\nThey do tremendous economic and ecological damage and are considered an invasive species.\nWhere Did Wild Hogs Come From?\nWild hogs, also called feral hogs, wild or feral pigs, razorbacks, or wild boars, are escaped domestic pigs and their descendants that live and breed in the wild. Domestic pigs originated with the Eurasian wild boar, which was domesticated in ancient times independently by people groups in Europe and Asia.\nPigs were first brought to the New World by Christopher Columbus and released to multiply on islands of the West Indies to provide a food supply for future explorers. This practice continued with other explorers in the 16th-17th centuries in the West Indies and southern parts of what is today the United States. Over the centuries, domestic pigs periodically escaped from farms in the South and joined feral (wild) pig populations. Their numbers today are estimated to be as high as 9 million in the United States.\nWild boar were introduced to Caribbean islands and the mainland of America by early Spanish explorers as a food source for future explorers. Over the years feral hogs have done incredible damage to fragile and unique ecosystems.\n©Simon Dannhauer/Shutterstock.com\nHow do Wild Hogs Affect the Environment?\nPigs plow up the ground with their snouts and tusks to find food, unearthing plants and the burrows of ground-dwelling species. They are omnivorous, consuming virtually any type of plant or small animal they can catch. They are particularly devastating to ground-nesting birds , running off the adults, eating eggs, and trampling nesting grounds. They compete with deer and turkeys for some of the same food sources, causing these species to migrate away when food becomes scarce. Studies have shown that the biodiversity of lower vertebrates in forested areas infested with wild hogs is 26% lower than normal.\nThey also trample, root around in, and wallow in ponds and streams, polluting them for fish or for other animals to drink and introducing disease-bearing bacteria into the water that can go far downstream. In fact, feral pigs can host up to 34 diseases that livestock, wildlife, or human beings can catch from contact with them, eating their meat, or ingesting water they have polluted. Pig farmers are greatly concerned they could bring back swine flu, a respiratory infection that was finally eradicated in the United States in 1978. Fortunately, humans rarely contract this particular disease, but it can be devastating to herds of domestic pigs.\nWild hogs also do tremendous damage to farmland and other private property. They uproot and trample valuable crops in fields, destroy gardens and landscaping, and can break down or root under fences that are not electrified, allowing other animals to escape. They can be quite aggressive and are able to inflict serious injuries with their tusks and teeth. When, on occasion, they wander into the yards of rural homes, they can pose a serious danger to curious pets and children. In Texas , the state with the largest feral hog population, they cost farmers an estimated $50 million a year in damage.\nWild boar have sharp teeth and tusks that can inflict serious injuries on people or pets.\n©iStock.com/JMrocek\nWild Hog Population by State\nReportedly, as many as 40 of the 50 United States have had sightings of feral hogs. Some states have successfully eradicated their populations, but the best estimates are that at least 28 states currently have established, breeding populations of this damaging invasive species. Estimates of the total number of wild hogs in the country vary but may range as high as 9 million.\nThe 10 States with Highest Feral Hog Numbers\nThe 10 states with the largest feral hog populations are Texas (3 million), Oklahoma (1.5 million), Louisiana (750,000), Georgia (600,000), Florida (500,000), New Mexico (500,000), South Carolina (450,000), California (400,000), Hawaii (400,000), and Alabama (250,000).\nWild boar particularly thrive in forested areas of warm southern states, but over the years have made their way as far north as Canada.\n©iStock.com/Jevtic\nFeral Hog Numbers in All 50 States\nHere’s a complete list of the wild boar population by state for all 50 states:\nAlabama: 250,000\nAlaska: none\nArizona: <1,000\nArkansas: 200,000\nCalifornia: 400,000\nColorado: none\nConnecticut: none\nDelaware: none\nFlorida: 500,000\nGeorgia: 600,000\nHawaii: 400,000\nIdaho: none\nIllinois: <20\nIndiana: <1,000\nIowa: <1,000\nKansas: 400\nKentucky: 2,000\nLouisiana: 750,000\nMaine: unknown\nMaryland: none\nMassachusetts: none\nMichigan: 5,000\nMinnesota: none\nMississippi: 200,000\nMissouri: 100,000\nMontana: unknown\nNebraska: unknown\nNevada: unknown\nNew Hampshire: unknown\nNew Jersey: <1,000\nNew Mexico: 500,000\nNew York: none\nNorth Carolina: 100,000\nNorth Dakota: unknown\nOhio: 2,000\nOklahoma: 1,500,000\nOregon: 5,000\nPennsylvania: 3,000\nRhode Island: none\nSouth Carolina: 450,000\nSouth Dakota: none\nTennessee: unknown\nTexas: 3,000,000\nUtah: unknown\nVermont: none\nVirginia: 3,000\nWashington: unknown; sighted in eastern counties\nWest Virginia: <1,000\nWisconsin: <1,000\nWyoming: none\nWild boar have been sighted in at least 40 states.\n©iStock.com/JMrocek\nHow are States Combatting Wild Hogs?\nSome of the ways some states are combatting wild hogs include:\nInformation: Federal, state, and private organizations, as well as academic institutions, study the movements and numbers of wild hogs to try to understand where they are increasing or declining, and why. This can also indicate where they may be close to crossing a state border so that neighboring states can be warned and consider what eradication efforts they might want to make.\nFencing: Agencies and landowners sometimes install specially designed fencing specifically to keep wild hogs out of undesirable areas. Sometimes these are electric fences with 3-4 strands of electric wire set to 16 joules or more, or woven wire fencing with barbed wire on the bottom to prevent wild hogs from rooting under it.\nHunting: Some states have established regular hunting seasons and sometimes incentivize hunters to kill wild hogs. Hunting regulations differ from state to state, but firearms, bowhunting, and trapping are all popular methods. Because wild pigs potentially carry so many diseases, it is imperative that hunters prepare the meat carefully to avoid sickening themselves and their families.\nTrapping: This is considered a more efficient method of reducing wild hog populations because it is less time-intensive than hunting. Traps work all the time without continual monitoring.\nPoisoning: This is a highly controversial approach because it can inadvertently hurt other species. States that have used this method have set up strict systems of regulations and monitoring.\nSterilization: Surgical sterilization or contraceptives can help reduce wild hog populations . Contraceptives can be dispensed as feed for hogs that will lower the sperm count in feral boars for 30 days. This approach does not kill the hogs, and it can be put in special hog feeders that other species cannot access.\nOne method of controlling wild hog populations is to set out hog feed laced with contraceptives for them. This reduces male fertility for 30 days, so it must be an ongoing process to have long-term results.\n©Jarosław Pocztarski / CC BY 2.0 – License\nSome of these methods are cringe-worthy and in some circumstances can be counter-productive. Aggressive hunting, for example, can drive wild hog populations out of remote forests toward populated areas, or into natural biomes that are even more fragile than the ones they are already damaging.\nHowever, wild hogs are clearly a man-made invasive species problem that requires an urgent, thoughtful, and well-coordinated response to protect biodiversity, the rural economy, and the safety of people who live near these wild pests.\nUp Next:\nWhat Do Boars Eat?\nWild Boar Teeth\nWild Boar Does Hulk Impression and Demolishes Metal Security Gate\nMore from A-Z Animals\nWatch a Gargantuan Komodo Dragon Effortlessly Swallow a Wild Boar\nWatch a Lioness Save Her Zookeeper When the Male Lion Attacks Him Point-Blank\nWatch This Huge Komodo Dragon Flex Its Power and Swallow a Shark Whole\nSee ‘Dominator’ – The Largest Crocodile In The World, And As Big As A Rhino\nThe Largest Great White Sharks Ever Found Off Florida Waters\nBiggest Wild Hog Ever?

Currently, I'm an \"Emotional Support Human\" to 4 dogs, 1 cat, and 2 guinea pigs. My favorite wild animal is the quokka, the most selfie-friendly animal in the world!\nFAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) \nHow many wild hogs are there in the United States?\nNo one is sure, but their numbers are estimated at up to 9 million.\nWhat U.S. state has the most wild hogs?\nTexas has the most wild hogs, at approximately 3 million.\nHow did wild hogs get to the United States?\nDomestic swine were released in the New World by early explorers to create a food source for explorers and colonists who would come after them. Their numbers multiplied in the wild, with regular additions of escaped pigs from farms.\nWhy are wild hogs a bad thing?\nThey are not indigenous to North America in the wild. They damage the biodiversity of habitats by rooting up plants and eating small animals that are food sources for indigenous species. They pollute water supplies by wallowing in streams and ponds. They spread dozens of different diseases, some of which can infect people. They damage farmland and private property as they root for food. They can be aggressive and inflict serious injuries on children and pets.\nThank you for reading! Have some feedback for us?

The animals body shape generally becomes fixed once the animal reaches maturity although some species of animal undergo series metamorphosis in later life such as the caterpillar which grows wings. Most animals are generally motile which means that they are able to move in their own. Animals are also considered heterotrophs, which means that they must ingest other organisms to survive, either plant or animal organisms. There is no way of knowing exactly how many species of animal exist as so many are found or become extinct each year. Estimates rate it at between 2 million and 50 million different species of animal on Earth.\nAntenna\nThe sensory feel on the head of an arthropod. Antennae are always present in pairs and can be sensitive to touch, taste, sound and heat. The size and shape of antennae varies widely depending on the animal species and the way in which it’s antennae are used.\n[Back to Top]\nAntler\nThe bony growth on the head of animals such as deer . Antlers are often much large than horns, branching out as they grow. In most cases, antlers are shed and re-grown every year in connection with the breeding season.\nArboreal Locomotion\nArboreal locomotion is the movement of animals in trees. In every habitat in which trees are present, animals have evolved to move in them. Some animals may only scale trees occasionally, while others are exclusively arboreal. These habitats pose numerous mechanical challenges to animals moving through them, leading to a variety of anatomical, behavioural and ecological consequences including the evolution of sharper claws and prehensile tails.. Furthermore, many of these same principles may be applied to climbing without trees, such as on rock piles or mountains.\nArthropod\nAn arthropod is an invertebrate that has an external skeleton (exoskeleton), a segmented body, and jointed leg-like attachments called appendages. The arthropod groups includes insects, arachnids, and crustaceans.\nAsexual Reproduction\nA form of reproduction that involves just one parent, and is most common in invertebrates. Asexual reproduction means that a species can quickly multiply it’s population numbers.\nAverage Clutch Size\nThe average number of eggs laid at once.\n[Back to Top]\nAverage Lifespan\nThe average time the animal lives for\nAverage Litter Size\nThe average number of babies born at once\nAverage Rainfall (Year)\nThe typical amount of rain that may fall in an area in a year.\nAverage Size\nThe average length (L) or height (H) of the animal\nAverage Spawn Size\nThe typical amount of eggs a fish may lay at once.\n[Back to Top]\nAverage Weight\nThe average measurement of how heavy the animal is\nBaleen\nA fibrous substance that is found in the mouths of some species of whale, which they use to filter food particles out of the water. The baleen plates grow out of the jaw in the same way as teeth, but trap food in the mouth which the whale then swallows.\nBiggest Threat\nThe largest danger to an animal, such as a predator or deforestation.\nBinocular Vision\nWhen the two eyes face forwards their field of vision overlaps allowing the animal to judge depth.\nBiome\nA grouping of living organisms, including the habitat in which they are found.\n[Back to Top]\nBipedal\nMoving on two legs\nBird\nBirds are warm blooded vertebrates that nest to lay their eggs, from which the bird offspring hatch. The birds skin is also covered in layers of feathers, to keep them warm but the feather also make the bird extremely light so it can fly without trouble. All birds have wings and most can fly over very long distance, some species of bird migrates thousands of mile every year, while others can only fly a few feet. The penguin is one of the only birds in the world that cannot fly as their wings are too small to lift their body. There are around 10,000 species of bird found worldwide, although studies suggest that many more species have become extinct. The bee hummingbird is the smallest species of bird in the world growing to around 5cm, with the ostrich being the largest species of bird and growing to nearly 3m tall.\nBlowhole\nThe nostrils of a whale are on the top of their head, and can be pair or singular.\nBreaching\nWhen an animals leaps out of the water and falls back in with a splash. Breaching is often a behaviour displayed by large whales.\nBrood Parasite\nWhen an animal (birds are common) tricks another species into raising it’s young.\n[Back to Top]\nBrowsing\nFeeding on the leaves that are on trees, bushes and shrubs higher up rather than eating the grass and plants on the ground.\nCalcareous\nCalcareous (calcium) structures are shells, bones and exoskeletons that are created by many animals to provide both support and protection.\nCamouflage\nColours or patterns are often displayed on an animal to help it to blend into it’s surroundings. Animals use camouflage to both hide and protect themselves from approaching predators but also to sure that they are not spotted by unsuspecting prey.\nCanine Tooth\nSome mammals have canine teeth which are strong and sharply pointed teeth. Canine teeth are generally found at the front of the jaw and are used for piercing and biting prey.\nCarnassial Tooth\nCarnivorous mammals have a carnassial tooth which is a blade-like tooth that is designed to slice through flesh.\n[Back to Top]\nCarnivore\nA carnivore is an animal that only eats other animals in order to ensure its own survival. Carnivorous animals have a complex digestive system that has adapted to breaking large amounts of meat, and therefore do not need to feed as often as herbivorous and omnivorous animals. Lions , crocodiles and sharks are all good example of animals that are carnivores.\nCarrion\nThe remains of dead animals.\nCartilage\nCartilage is a rubbery substance that helps to form part of the skeleton in vertebrates.\nCellulose\nCellulose is a complex carbohydrate found in plants that many animals find difficult to break down. Herbivorous grazing animals, are able to digest it with the help of micro-organisms.\nChelicera\nChelicerae are the first pairs of appendages of the front of an arachnids body. Some arachnids have pincers on the end and some spiders can inject venom through them.\n[Back to Top]\nChordate\nAn animal belong to the phylum Chordata, which includes all vertebrates.\nChrysalis\nA hard and shiny case that protect insect pupa, that is often found attached to plants or buried in the soil.\nCirculatory System\nAn animals circulatory system involves the animals heart, blood vessels and blood which flows around the animals body, transporting nutrients to cells that need them and removing waste products from others. The blood is powered by the animals heart which beats on average around 100 times a minute (this obviously depends on the animal though).\nClass\nA level of classifying animals in a phylum. Classes are then sub-divided into further groups known as orders.\nCloven-hoofed\nAnimals such as deer and antelope have hooves that look like they are split in two.\n[Back to Top]\nCocoon\nA nest made by insects of woven silk, often to protect eggs or pupae.\nCold Blooded\nHaving a body temperate that is reliant on it’s surroundings.\nColony\nA group of animals from the same species, that spend their lives together and often have individual tasks that help with the overall survival of the colony.\nColor\nThe color of the animal’s coat or markings\nCommon Name\nThe most widely used name for this species of animal.\n[Back to Top]\nCompound Eye\nAn eye that is divided up into separate compartments, each with its own set of lenses. Compound eyes are most commonly found in arthropods and can contain from a few to thousands of lenses.\nConservation Status\nThe conservation status of a species is an indicator of the likelihood of that species remaining extant either in the present day or the near future. Many factors are taken into account when assessing the conservation status of a species: not simply the number remaining, but the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates and known threats. Scientifically, animals come into 9 different categories which are least concern, near threatened, conservation dependent, threatened, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild and extinct. A-Z Animals groups the animals into just four different categories which are least concern (covering the categories least concern, near threatened and conservation dependent), threatened (covering the categories threatened and vulnerable), endangered (covering the categories endangered, critically endangered and extinct in the wild) and extinct.  \nLeast Concern is a category assigned to extant species which have been evaluated but do not qualify for any other category. Many common species are assigned to the least concern category but the species has to have been evaluated to be classified in the least concern category.\nNear Threatened is a conservation status assigned to species that may be considered threatened with extinction in the near future, although it does not currently qualify for the threatened status. As such it is important to re-evaluate Near Threatened species often or at appropriate intervals.\nConservation Dependent is a category assigned to extant species that rely on conservation efforts to prevent them from being threatened from extinction.\nThreatened species are any species of living organism which are vulnerable to extinction in the near future. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) is the main authority on threatened species, and treats threatened species not as a single category, but as a group of three categories: vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered, depending on the degree to which they are threatened.\nVulnerable species are species which are likely to become endangered unless the circumstances threatening their survival and reproduction improve.\nEndangered species are a population of organisms which are at risk of becoming extinct because they are either few in numbers, or threatened by environmental changes or changes in the behaviours of their predators. Many nations have laws offering protection to conservation reliant species: for example, forbidding hunting, restricting land development or creating preserves. Only a few of the many species at risk of extinction actually make it to the lists and obtain legal protection. Many more species become extinct, or potentially will become extinct, without gaining public notice.\nCritically Endangered species are organisms that are of an extremely high risk of becoming extinct in the wild or completely extinct in the immediate future.\nExtinct in the Wild is a conservation status assigned to species where the only known living members are being kept in captivity or as a naturalized population outside it’s historic and natural range.\nExtinct species no longer exist anywhere on Earth. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species.\nCryptic Colouration\nAn animal uses certain colours and markings in order to make itself invisible in its surroundings.\nDelayed Implantation\nIn some mammals, there can be a delay between when the egg is fertilised and when the embryo begins to develop.\nDeposit Feeder\nAn animal that feeds on small particles of organic matter that have drifted down to and settle on the bottom.\n[Back to Top]\nDetritivore\nAn animals that feeds on dead plant and animal matter.\nDewlap\nA flap of loose skin that hangs from an animal’s neck.\nDiet\nWhat kind of foods the animal eats\nDigit\nFingers or toes.\nDistinctive Features\nCharacteristics unique to the animal.\n[Back to Top]\nDiurnal\nIf an animal is diurnal it means that the animal tends to sleep during the dark, night hours and wakes up to hunt when the sun rises in the morning. Humans, bears and horses are considered to be diurnal animals.\nDomesticated\nAn animal that lives with humans or is looked after by them.\nDorsal Fin\nLarge fin on the back of marine animals such as fish, sharks, whales and dolphins .\nEchinoderm\nEchinoderms are spiny-skinned invertebrates that are found on the ocean floor. Echinoderms are armoured animals that have a hard internal skeleton (endoskeleton) made up of plates and spines. Echinoderms are slow-moving creatures that have a water-vascular system which pumps water through the body. Echinoderms also have small jaws that are supported by the water-vascular system and tube feet which they use to attach to objects for protection, as well as to obtain food. Echinoderms generally have radial symmetry and most can regenerate lost limbs.\nEcholocation\nA way of sensing nearby objects by using pulse of high-frequency sound.\n[Back to Top]\nEcological Niche\nThe term niche is used to describe an animals specific function or purpose within a certain habitat. Most species of animal play an integral part in keeping their surrounding ecosystem running, whether it be the spreading of seeds or predatory animals that hunt smaller species of animal.\nEcosystem\nThe term ecosystem is used to describe the working together of different species of animal within a particular habitat, a good example of this being the basic food chain.\nEctoparasite\nAn animal that lives on the surface of another animal’s body, generally by sucking it’s blood.\nEmbryo\nA young animal in the first stages of development.\nEndoparasite\nAn animal that lives inside another animal’s body, both eat the tissues and food.\n[Back to Top]\nEndoskeleton\nAn internal skeleton that supports an animal’s body and is generally made of bone.\nEnvironment\nThe term environment is used to describe the conditions surrounding a certain organism as a whole. This includes everything from the social structure of life contained within that environment from animals to plants, but also is a method of describing how all the different organisms in one area interact with each other. The are numerous different environments throughout the world including desert environments, jungle environments and mountainous environments. The term environment basically refers to all living and non-living things in the world or a particular region.\nEstimated Population Size\nHow many of a particular species are thought to exist at this time.\nEvolution\nEvolution is the process by which different species of animals evolve, generally in accordance with natural selection and to make life more successful for the species. For example, certain species of moth have known to completely change colour in just a few generations because of pollution, and the horse we know today evolved from having many toes, to just having a single toe today.\nExoskeleton\nAn external skeleton that supports and protects the animal’s body.\n[Back to Top]\nExternal Fertilisation\nFertilisation that occurs outside of the womb, normally in water\nExtinct\nWhen the entire species has disappeared from Earth\nFamily\nA level of classifying animals within an order. Orders are broken down in families and families are broken down further into smaller groups called genus.\nFavourite Food\nThe preferred food of an animal. For example, Penguins may eat Crab or Squid, but typically prefer to eat Fish – this may because they are easier to catch, eat or digest.\nFemur\nThe femur is the thigh bone in all vertebrates that have four limbs including elephants , lions and humans.\n[Back to Top]\nFeral\nA feral animal is an animal that was brought up domestically but has then begun to live life in the wild.\nFertilisation\nThe meeting of a female animal’s egg cell and a male animal’s sperm, which creates a cell able of developing into a new animal.\nFilter Feeder\nAn animal that feeds by extracting small particles of food out of the water.\nFish\nFish are cold blooded vertebrates that live in the waters of rivers, lakes and oceans worldwide. Fish have scales covering their skin and usually an oily layer on the surface of the fishes skin, which helps to regulate the body of temperature of the fish. Fish have gills on the sides of their heads which allows the fish to breath underwater, due to their complex respiratory (breathing) system. There thought to be around 32,000 different species of fish found in freshwater and saltwater sources alike, with over 1,000 of these now considered to be critically endangered. Fish are a stable food source for many species of mammals, birds and reptiles around the world.\nFlight Feathers\nThe wings and tail feather of a bird that are used in flight.\n[Back to Top]\nFlipper\nA flat paddle-shaped limb that many aquatic mammals have.\nFluke\nMany whales and their relatives have a rubbery tail flipper which is known as a fluke.\nFoetus\nA developing animal that is nearing the time of birth.\nFood Chain\nAn animal food chain is the sequence of who eats whom within an ecosystem in order for each animal to obtain nutrition. A food chain starts with the primary energy source, which is usually the sun and the food chain is then connected by a series of organisms that eat each other, in turn. The food chain starts with the sun and is then followed by the primary producers, then the primary consumer, then the secondary consumer, followed by the tertiary consumer and finishing with the quaternary consumer which is generally an animal that is eaten by nothing else and is therefore the end of the food chain. Food chains are never the same as each ecosystem contains different organisms within it. If one part of the food chain is missing then there will be high population levels in the links before the missing part of the food chain, as nothing is eating them, and there will also be lower population levels in the links after the missing part in the food chain, as those animals have nothing to eat. The food chain is then said to be out of balance, so it is crucial for food chains to remain unaltered in order for balance within the animal kingdom to remain.\nFood Chain: 1. Primary Producer\nPrimary producers are those organisms that require nothing but the natural resources of the Earth in order to thrive and survive. Primary producers tend to be plants that are photosynthetic and these plants use the energy provided by sunlight in order to make their own food using a process called photosynthesis. Other primary consumers include bacteria that make their own food using chemicals that are produced in natural vents in the ocean. Primary producers are also known as autotrophs and are vital to the survival of the animals that follow in the next stages of the food chain.\n[Back to Top]\nFood Chain: 2. Primary Consumer\nThe primary consumers are the next stage in the food chain behind the sun and the primary producers. The primary consumers are the herbivorous animals of the world and consume the primary producers (autotrophs) in order to gain their nutrition. For example, an insect (primary consumer) will eat the seeds and sprouts that are provided by grass (primary producer). Primary consumers are also known as heterotrophs.\nFood Chain: 3. Secondary Consumer\nThe secondary consumers link in with the food chain as they are the omnivorous animals that eat the primary consumers and the secondary consumers will occasionally eat the primary producers in order to supplement their diet. For example, a rat (secondary consumer) will eat an insect (primary consumer) that has gained its nutrition from eating the grass (primary producer). Secondary consumers are also known as heterotrophs.\nFood Chain: 4. Tertiary Consumer\nThe secondary consumers are followed by the tertiary consumers, the tertiary consumers tend to be the smaller carnivores of the animal kingdom. The tertiary consumers only eat meat and therefore really on the consistency of the secondary consumer populations in order to continue to thrive as a species. For example, a snake (tertiary consumer) will eat a rat (secondary consumer) that has gained its nutrition from eating an insect (primary consumer), and the insect has gained its nutrition from eating the grass (primary producer). Tertiary consumers are also known as heterotrophs.\nFood Chain: 5. Quaternary Consumer\nThe final part to the food chain are the quaternary consumers, and these are the animals that tend to be large carnivores and dominant predators within their natural environment. Quaternary consumers generally have few, if any, natural predators at all and this tends to be where the food chain ends. For example, an eagle (quaternary consumer) will eat a snake (tertiary consumer), that has eaten a rat (secondary consumer), that has eaten an insect (primary consumer), that has eaten the grass (primary producer) that has used the energy from the sun in order to make food.\nFood Chain: Examples\nSun –> Grass –> Insect –> Rat –> Snake –> Eagle   Sun –> Phytoplankton –> Krill –> Squid –> Seal –> Polar Bear\n[Back to Top]\nFood Web\nThe interlinking of a collection of food chains from one habitat.\nFrugivorous\nAn animal that feeds on fruit.\nFun Fact\nAn exciting thing that is known about an animal.\nGenus\nA level of classifying animals within a family. Families are divided into sub-groups called genus which generally contain one or two animal species.\nGestation Period\nThe gestation period is the time from conception to birth in which a mammal embryo is developing. The gestation period is different for almost every species of animal, for example, the gestation period for a human embryo is roughly 9 months but the gestation period for a kangaroo embryo is only around 30 days.\n[Back to Top]\nGill\nAn external organ used by aquatic animals such as fish, to extract oxygen out of the water.\nGrazing\nFeeding on grass and ground-level plants and foliage.\nGroup\nThe domestic group such as cat or dog\nGroup Behaviour\nHow an animal behaves when in a group. For example, Elephants live together in herds, whereas a Jaguar is a solitary animal which lives on its own.\nHabitat\nThe term habitat is used to describe a specific area where a particular animal lives, within an environment. Many animals have adapted to requiring specific conditions which can only be found in their natural habitat such as those animals that live in the polar regions that have longer, thicker body fur to keep them warm.\n[Back to Top]\nHerbivore\nA herbivore is an animal that only eats plant material, algae and bacteria in order to gain its nutrition. Those animals that are herbivorous have adapted to digest plant material specifically, such as elephants, donkeys and rabbits .\nHermaphrodite\nAn animal that has both male and female reproductive organs so that it is able to self-fertilize.\nHibernation\nWhen an animal hibernates, it isn’t as simple as the animal just sleeping for a long time. When an animal sleeps, the animals brain is still active so the animal is able to move around in their sleep and can also wake up quickly. When an animal hibernates, the animals heart rate slows down, the animals body temperature drops as it is exposed to cold surroundings and the animals breathing slows down meaning that the animal takes longer than usual to wake up. The animal spends the months before it hibernates eating lots of food to make sure its body has enough energy to survive the winter. Some animals are in hibernation for the duration of the winter meaning they don’t wake up at all, others wake up every few weeks to have a snack and walk about before going back into hibernation.\nHome Range\nThe area that an animal or group of animals lives in.\nHorn\nA hard, pointed growth on the head of some mammals.\n[Back to Top]\nHost\nThe animal which a parasite is feeding on or in.\nHyperparasite\nA parasite that attacks other parasites.\nIncisor Tooth\nA flat tooth at the front of a mammal’s jaw that is used for gnawing and slicing food.\nIncubation Period\nThe incubation period is the time from when an animal egg is laid to when it hatches. The term incubation period is used to refer to all egg laying mammals like fish, birds and reptiles but also to the platypus and the echidna which are the only egg laying mammals on earth. The incubation period varies between animal species from the incubation period of a penguin egg which is around 60 days to the incubation period of the an iguana egg which is between three and four months.\nInsect\nInsects are invertebrate arthropods, which means that the insects body is made up of sections of shell rather than bones. There are more than 1 million described species of insect found worldwide, but estimates suggest there to be around 30 million different species of insect still left to identify. Insects are found in every habitat around the world from the deserts, to the jungles and in the mountains. Some species of insect also live in or around water such as the mosquito and the dragonfly . Insects generally have a lifespan that is less than a year, although some types of insects such as beetles , have been known to live for more than a few years.\n[Back to Top]\nInsectivore\nAn animal that feeds on insects.\nInternal Fertilization\nFertilisation that occurs inside the body of the female.\nIntroduced Species\nA species that has been accidentally or purposefully been introduced, by humans, into an eco-system where it is not found naturally.\nInvertebrate\nInvertebrates are animals that do not have a spinal column (back bone), which surprisingly accounts for around 98% of the worlds described animals with the exception of mammals, reptiles , birds and bony fish all of which have a spinal column and are therefore classified as vertebrates, making up the final 2% of described animals.\nKeel\nAn enlargement of the breastbone in birds, that secures the muscles during flight.\n[Back to Top]\nKeratin\nA strong and resilient structural protein that is found in an animals hair, nails and horn.\nKingdom\nA level of classifying all living things on earth, as similar species are broken into 5 groups including plants, animals and fungi.\nLarva\nA young insect that is independent of an looks very different from the adult form. Insect larva become adults through a metamorphic process.\nLifespan\nThe length of time an animal lives.\nLifestyle\nWhether the animal is solitary or sociable.\n[Back to Top]\nLitter Size\nThe typical number of offspring an animal may give birth to at one time.\nLocation\nThe place in the world where something is found. For example, Chameleons can be found in forests in Madagascar.\nMammal\nMammals are warm blooded vertebrates that have mammary glands, which means that the females are able to produce milk to feed their young. Mammals are also the only animal group that gives bird to live young, where the others all lay eggs. Mammals are generally land-dwelling animals but there are exceptions like the blue whale, which is the worlds largest mammal and grows to around 20 times the size of the biggest land mammal, the African elephant , average about 33 meters in length.. The smallest mammal in the world is the bumble bee bat which is only 3.5 cm tall. There are approximately 5,400 different species of mammal found worldwide.\nMandible\nThe paired jaws of an arthropod such as ants , crabs and spiders.\nMelon\nA large swelling of fatty-fluid that is found in the heads of many toothed whales, that is believed to improve sound focus used in echolocation.\n[Back to Top]\nMetabolic Rate\nThe rate of an animal’s metabolism can be affected by many factors including size and energy.\nMetabolism\nA mixture of chemical processes that occur within the body of an animal to either release energy (breaking down food) or to consume it (muscle movement).\nMetacarpal\nThe metacarpal is one of a set of bones that is found in either or the arm or the leg in all vertebrates with four limbs.\nMetamorphosis\nThe complete change in body shape when certain animals move from being young animals into adults.\nMetatarsal\nThe metatarsal is one of a set of bones found in the back of the leg in all vertebrates with four limbs.\n[Back to Top]\nMigration\nThe migration of animals is generally connected with the seasons and involves with travelling between one place and another, often along a well-known route.\nMimicry\nWhen one animal attempts to camouflage itself by resembling another animal or an object such as a leaf or a stick.\nMolar Tooth\nA flattened or ridged tooth found at the back of the jaw in mammals, that is used for chewing.\nMollusc\nMolluscs are a group of animals that are found in both marine and freshwater habitats. There are nearly 100,000 different species of animal in the mollusc group, which makes up more than 20% of animal life in the water. The octopus and the squid are both molluscs.\nMonogamous\nMating with a single partner for life or throughout the breeding season.\n[Back to Top]\nMolt\nThe shedding of fur, feathers, scales and skin so that it can be renewed and replaced.\nName Of Young\nThe name given to the offspring of an animal, for example a young Cat is called a Kitten.\nNatural Environment\nThe term environment is used to describe everything in a certain area. This includes the terrain such as mountains and deserts, the natural elements that are found there like water and metal, the climate and all the living and non-living things in that area like animals, plants and objects.\nNatural Selection\nThe term natural selection refers to the the process where heritable traits that make it more likely for an organism to survive long enough to reproduce become more common over successive generations of a population. This can include anything from the exterior appearance of an organism (for example those that are most easily camouflaged tend to fair better) to the temperament of an organism (for example, a lion would have more difficulty in hunting prey if it was irrational and clumsy in behaviour instead of being stealthy and systematic in it’s actions). Natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution.\nNew World\nNorth, Central and South America.\n[Back to Top]\nNew World Monkeys\nNew World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America. New World monkeys differ from other groupings of monkeys and primates, such as the Old World monkeys and the apes, mainly in the fact that New World monkeys tend to be small to medium in size. The New World monkey group includes the world’s smallest monkey, the pygmy marmoset . New World moneys are different from the Old World monkeys in many ways, including the fact that the nose of New World monkeys is flat and has side facing nostrils, the lack of opposable thumbs and due to the fact that most New World monkeys are arboreal, they often have prehensile tails.\nNiche\nAn animal’s place or role in it’s habitat.\nNocturnal\nIf an animal is nocturnal it means that the animal tends to sleep during the daylight hours and wakes up to hunt when night falls. Raccoons , koalas and hedgehogs are all considered to be nocturnal animals.\nNumber of Species\nThe total number of recorded species\nNymph\nA young insect that is similar in appearance to it’s parents but it does not yet have functioning organs or is able to fly.\n[Back to Top]\nOffspring\nAn offspring is an animal’s child or children. For example, a Kitten is the offspring of a Cat.\nOld World\nEurope, Africa , Asia and Australasia.\nOld World Monkeys\nThe Old World monkeys are native to Africa and Asia today, inhabiting a range of environments from tropical rain forest to savannah, scrubland, and mountainous terrain, and are also known from Europe in the fossil record. However, a (possibly introduced) free-roaming group of monkeys still survives in Gibraltar (Europe) to this day. Old World monkeys include many of the most familiar species of non-human primates such as baboons and macaques. Old World monkeys tend to be medium to large in size and tend to have a predominantly herbivorous diet preferring to eat plant matter rather than other animals. Old World monkeys are known to have an opposable thumb and rarely have prehensile tails.\nOmnivore\nAn omnivore is an animal that eats both plant material and other animals in order to get enough food. Animals that are omnivores have complex digestive systems that are able to deal with both plant animal material equally well, like kangaroos , otters and humans.\nOpposable\nDigits that are able to be pressed together from opposite directions, like thumbs in humans and apes.\n[Back to Top]\nOptimum pH Level\nThe perfect acidity conditions for the animal\nOrder\nA level used to classify animals. Classes are broken into sub-groups known as order, which are broken down further into families.\nOrgan\nA structure found in an animal’s body that is made up of tissues and does a specific task.\nOrganism\nIn biological terms, an organism is used to describe a living thing whether animal, plant, fungi or micro-organisms. Some organisms are single-celled organisms meaning that they consist of one cell that has a central nerve in the middle, for example bacteria. Other organisms are multi-celled organisms meaning that they consist of many cells all working together, for example humans.\nOrigin\nThe area where the animal first came from\n[Back to Top]\nOther Name(s)\nDifferent names which an animal may be called. For example, a Black Panther may also be called a Black Leopard, or a Black Jaguar.\nOviparous\nReproducing by laying eggs.\nParasite\nAn animal that lives on or inside another animal.\nParatoid Gland\nA gland found behind the eyes of some amphibians that secretes poison onto the surface of their skin.\nPartial Migrant\nAn animal species where some individuals migrate but others don’t.\n[Back to Top]\nPectoral Fin\nOne of the two pairs of fins that are found at the front of the body of a fish.\nPelvic Fins\nThe last pair of fins on the body of a fish, found on the underside, close to the tail.\nPheromone\nA chemical produced by an animal which has an effect on animals from the same species but also on other animal species too.\nPhotosynthesis\nThe chemical process which plants use to create energy.\nPhylum\nA level of classifying animals within the animal kingdom. Phylum are further divided into subgroups called classes.\n[Back to Top]\nPinna\nThe external ear flaps found on mammals.\nPlacenta\nAn organ that is produced by a developing animal that allows it to absorb nutrients from the mother’s bloodstream when it is in the womb.\nPlankton\nFloating microscopic organisms that drift close to the surface of the sea in open water.\nPlant Types\nThe typical types of plants which are found in a particular location.\nPolygamous\nWhen male animals often made with several female animals throughout the breeding season.\n[Back to Top]\nPredator\nWhen an animal is referred to as a predator, it means that the animal either hunts or catches other animals. Predatory animals are generally dominant within their environment and will generally hunt animals smaller than themselves.\nPredators\nOther animals that hunt and eat the animal\nPrehensile\nPrehensile is the term that is given the appendages of animals that have evolved to grasp or hold onto things. For example, some species of monkey and most species of lizard have prehensile tails which allows them to hold onto tree branches with their tails so that they can reach down to collect food. Most species of primates have prehensile hands and cats are known to have prehensile claws. The tongues of many animals are prehensile, particularly that of the giraffe . Elephants and tapirs are known to have prehensile noses, and horses and rhinos have prehensile lips.\nPremolar Tooth\nA specialised tooth that is found about half-way along the jaw in mammals, that is often used for slicing through flesh.\nPrey\nWhen an animal is referred to prey, it means that the animal is either hunted or caught for food. Animals that are referred to as prey are generally hunted by bigger animals, although there are a number of exceptions.\n[Back to Top]\nProboscis\nThe nose of an animal, or parts of the mouth which are nose-like in shape.\nPupa\nIn stage in the development of insects when the body of the larva is broken down and turned into the body of an adult.\nQuadrupedal\nMovement on four limbs.\nReproduction\nReproduction is the biological process by which new individual organisms are produced. Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known life as each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. Reproduction requires a male and female counterpart in order to create new offspring.\nReptile\nReptiles are cold blooded vertebrates that have scales covering their skin rather than hair or feathers. Reptiles are found on every continent worldwide with the exception of the polar Antarctica. There are more than 8,000 species of recorded reptile split into four main groups. The order Crocodilia contains 23 species that are crocodiles, gavials, caimans, and alligators; the order Sphenodontia are the tuatara from New Zealand, of which there are 2 different species; the order Squamata is lizards , snakes, and amphisbaenids or worm-lizards, of which there are approximately 7,900 species; the order Testudines covers turtles, tortoises, and terrapins with around 300 species found worldwide. Reptiles are also egg laying animal and are known to bask for long hours during the day in the hot sun to heat up the reptiles cold blood, so the reptile has enough energy to hunt at night.\n[Back to Top]\nRespiratory System\nAll animals have a respiratory system which allows the animal to take in oxygen from the environment (breath in) that the animals blood needs to stay healthy. The process of respiration produces carbon dioxide as a waste product, which is then eliminated from the animal (breath out) and back into the environment.\nRuminant\nA hoofed and herbivorous mammals that has a specialised digestive system with more than one stomach chamber.\nSaprophagous\nFeeding on decaying and dead matter.\nScientific Name\nThe scientific name is the name used by scientists to refer to a particular species of animal.\nSedentary\nHaving a lifestyle that involves little movement.\n[Back to Top]\nSessile\nA sessile animal attaches itself to another object and cannot move independently.\nSexual Dimorphism\nThe physical differences between males and females.\nSilk\nA fibrous material that is produced by spiders and some insects.\nSize\nHow long (L) or tall (H) the animal is\nSkeletal System\nThe animals skeletal system is made up of all the bones, joints and cartilage in the animals body. The animals skeletal system is not only essential for protecting supporting the animals body, but also helps to make new blood cells and stores vital minerals.\n[Back to Top]\nSkin Type\nThe protective layer of the animal\nSpecies\nA group of similar animals that are capable of interbreeding that results in the production of fertile offspring.\nSternum\nThe breastbone in all vertebrates that have four limbs.\nSubfamily\nA division of the family classification before the genus classification.\nSuspension Feeder\nAn animal that feeds on the organic particles that are suspended in the water.\n[Back to Top]\nTemperament\nThe way the animal thinks, behaves or reacts\nTemperature\nThe degree or intensity of heat in an area.\nTerrestrial\nAn animals that spends it’s whole life or the majority of it’s life on the ground.\nTerritory\nAn area that is defended by an animal or a group of animals, against animals of the same species.\nTibia\nThe bone found in the shin of all vertebrates with four limbs.\n[Back to Top]\nTissue\nA layer of cell in the body of an animal.\nTop Speed\nThe fastest recorded speed of the animal\nTrachea\nA breathing tube found in vertebrates, which is known as the windpipe.\nTraining\nThe level of house-training needed for the animal\nTubercle\nA hard swelling somewhere on the body of an animal.\n[Back to Top]\nTusk\nA modified tooth to protrudes out of the mouth of some mammals.\nType\nThe animal group that the species belongs to\nTypes\nVariations of a particular habitat. For example, there are two kinds of mountain, temperate and tropical.\nUnderfur\nThe dense layer of fur that is closet to the body of the animal to keep it warm.\nUterus\nThe part of the body in female mammals where the young are developed.\n[Back to Top]\nVertebrate\nVertebrates are animals with a spinal column (back bone) and include mammals, reptiles, birds and fish.

[3] The massif is 55 kilometres (34 mi) long, and is bounded by the Kali Gandaki Gorge on the west, the Marshyangdi River on the north and east, and by Pokhara Valley on the south. At the western end, the massif encloses a high basin called the Annapurna Sanctuary . The highest peak of the massif, Annapurna I Main , is the tenth highest mountain in the world at 8,091 metres (26,545 ft) above sea level. Maurice Herzog led a French expedition to its summit through the north face in 1950, making it the first eight-thousand meter peak ever successfully climbed. [4]\nThe name for the range comes from the Hindu deity Annapurna meaning the giver of food and nourishment due to the evergreen flowing rivers originating from this mountain range which generates greenery and supports vegetation year round on the lower plains. She is also believed to be one of the daughters of Himavat , the king of the mountains. [5]\nThe entire massif and surrounding area are protected within the 7,629-square-kilometre (2,946 sq mi) Annapurna Conservation Area , the first and largest conservation area in Nepal. The Annapurna Conservation Area is home to several world-class treks , including Annapurna Sanctuary and Annapurna Circuit .\nHistorically, the Annapurna peaks have been among the world's most treacherous mountains to climb with the particular case of the extremely steep south face of Annapurna I Main – a wall of rock that rises 3,000 metres (9,800 feet) – making it one of the most difficult climbs in the world. [6] By January 2022, there had been 365 summit ascents of Annapurna I Main, and 72 climbing fatalities for a fatality rate of just under 20 percent.\nPeaks [ edit ]\nThe Annapurna massif contains six prominent peaks over 7,200 m (23,620 ft) elevation:\nMountain\nElevation\nAnnapurna I (Main)\n8,091 m (26,545 ft)\nAnnapurna I Central\n8,051 m (26,414 ft)\nAnnapurna I East\n8,010 m (26,280 ft)\nAnnapurna II\n7,937 m (26,040 ft)\nAnnapurna III\n7,555 m (24,786 ft)\nAnnapurna IV\n7,525 m (24,688 ft)\nAnnapurna South\n7,219 m (23,684 ft)\nAnnapurna Fang\n7,647 m (25,089 ft)\nKhangsar Kang\n7,485 m (24,557 ft)\nTarke Kang\n7,202 m (23,629 ft)\nLachenal Peak\n7,140 m (23,425 ft)\nTilicho Peak\n7,135 m (23,409 ft)\nNilgiri Himal North\n7,061 m (23,166 ft)\nNilgiri Himal Central\n6,940 m (22,769 ft)\nNilgiri Himal South\n6,839 m (22,438 ft)\nMachhapuchchhre\n6,993 m (22,943 ft)\nHiunchuli\n6,441 m (21,132 ft)\nGandharba Chuli\n6,248 m (20,499 ft)\nGangapurna\n7,455 m (24,457 ft)\nClimbing history [ edit ]\nGangapurna was first climbed 6 May 1965, by a German expedition led by Günther Hauser, via the East Ridge. The summit party comprised 11 members of the expedition.\nAnnapurna South (also known as Annapurna Dakshin, or Moditse) was first climbed in 1964 by a Japanese expedition, via the North Ridge. The summit party comprised S. Uyeo and Mingma Tsering.\nHiunchuli (6,441 m/21,126 ft) is a satellite peak extending east from Annapurna South, Hiunchuli was first climbed in 1971 by an expedition led by U.S. Peace Corps Volunteer Craig Anderson.\nMount Machhapuchchhre (6,993 m or 22,943 ft), named after its resemblance to a fish-tail, is another important peak, though it just misses the 7,000 metre mark. Mount Machhapuchchhre and Hiunchuli are prominently visible from the valley of Pokhara. These peaks are the \"gates\" to the Annapurna Sanctuary leading to the south face of Annapurna I. Mount Machhapuchchhre was climbed in 1957 (except the final 50 metres for its local religious sanctity) by Wilfrid Noyce and A. D. M. Cox. Since then it has been off limits.\nTrekking [ edit ]\nThe Annapurna Conservation Area (7,629 km 2 ) is a well known trekking region. There are three major trekking routes in the Annapurna region: the Jomson Trek to Jomsom and Muktinath (increasingly disturbed by a road-building project [7] ); the Annapurna Sanctuary route to Annapurna base camp; and the Annapurna Circuit , which circles the Annapurna Himal itself and includes the Jomsom route. [8] The town of Pokhara usually serves as a starting point for these treks, and is also a good starting place for other short treks of one to four days, such as routes to Ghorepani or Ghandruk .\nThe Mustang district, a former kingdom bordering Tibet, is also geographically a part of the Annapurna region, but treks to upper Mustang are subject to special restrictions. Mustang is also increasingly becoming popular for mountain biking because of the construction of roads undertaken by the Nepali government in the region.\nAbout two-thirds of all trekkers in Nepal visit the Annapurna region. The area is easily accessible, guest houses in the hills are plentiful, and treks here offer incredibly diverse scenery, with both high mountains and lowland villages. Also, because the entire area is inhabited, trekking in the region offers unique cultural exposure and experience. [9] [10] Trekkers are required to purchase a special permit for trekking from the Nepal Immigration Office, with the permit generally being valid for ten days. [11]\n2014 trekking disaster [ edit ]\nMain article: 2014 Nepal snowstorm disaster\nIn October 2014, at least 43 people were killed, and some 175 injured, as a result of snowstorms and avalanches on and around Annapurna, including trekkers from Nepal, Israel, Canada, India, Slovakia and Poland. Between 10 and 50 people were thought likely to be missing. [12] [13] It was believed that about 100 trekkers had left a guest house at 4,800 metres (15,700 ft), to climb to the top of Thorong La pass and then descend. [13]\nThe authorities were criticized for not giving sufficient warning of the approaching bad weather. [13] By 18 October, some 289 people were reported as having been rescued. An official from the Nepal Ministry of Tourism said on 18 October that helicopters were looking for survivors and bodies in snowy areas at up to 5,790 metres (19,000 ft), and were trying to reach 22 hikers stranded at Thorong La. The incident was said to be Nepal's worst-ever trekking disaster. [14]\nSee also [ edit ]\nDhaulagiri (mountain range)\nReferences [ edit ]\n^\n\"Annapurna\" .

It is the world's most populous country , with a population exceeding 1.4 billion, slightly ahead of India . China spans the equivalent of five time zones and borders fourteen countries by land, [l] the most of any country in the world, tied with Russia . With an area of approximately 9.6 million square kilometres (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the world's third largest country by total land area. [m] The country consists of 22 provinces , [n] five autonomous regions , four municipalities , and two special administrative regions ( Hong Kong and Macau ). The national capital is Beijing , and the most populous city and largest financial center is Shanghai .\nModern Chinese trace their origins to a cradle of civilization in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . The semi-legendary Xia dynasty in the 21st century BCE and the well-attested Shang and Zhou dynasties developed a bureaucratic political system to serve hereditary monarchies, or dynasties . Chinese writing , Chinese classic literature , and the Hundred Schools of Thought emerged during this period and influenced China and its neighbors for centuries to come. In the third century BCE, Qin Shi Huang founded the first Chinese empire, the short-lived Qin dynasty . The Qin was followed by the more stable Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), which established a model for nearly two millennia in which the Chinese empire was one of the world's foremost economic powers . The empire expanded, fractured, and reunified; was conquered and reestablished; absorbed foreign religions and ideas; and made world-leading scientific advances, such as the Four Great Inventions : gunpowder , paper , the compass , and printing . After centuries of disunity following the fall of the Han , the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) dynasties reunified the empire. The multi-ethnic Tang welcomed foreign trade and culture that came over the Silk Road and adapted Buddhism to Chinese needs. The early modern\nSong dynasty (960–1279) became increasingly urban and commercial. The civilian scholar-officials or literati used the examination system and the doctrines of Neo-Confucianism to replace the military aristocrats of earlier dynasties. The Mongol invasion established the Yuan dynasty in 1279, but the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) re-established Han Chinese control. The Manchu -led Qing dynasty nearly doubled the empire's territory and established a multi-ethnic state that was the basis of the modern Chinese nation, but suffered heavy losses to foreign imperialism in the 19th century.\nThe Chinese monarchy collapsed in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China (ROC) replaced the Qing dynasty. In its early years as a republic , the country underwent a period of instability known as the Warlord Era before mostly reunifying in 1928 under a Nationalist government . A civil war between the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) began in 1927. Japan invaded China in 1937, starting the Second Sino-Japanese War and temporarily halting the civil war. The surrender and expulsion of Japanese forces from China in 1945 left a power vacuum in the country, which led to renewed fighting between the CCP and the Kuomintang. The civil war ended in 1949 [o] with the division of Chinese territory ; the CCP established the People's Republic of China on the mainland while the Kuomintang-led ROC government retreated to the island of Taiwan . [p] Both claim to be the sole legitimate government of China , although the United Nations has recognized the PRC as the sole representation since 1971 . From 1959 to 1961, the PRC implemented an economic and social campaign called the \" Great Leap Forward \" that resulted in a sharp economic decline and an estimated 15 to 55 million deaths , mostly through man-made famine. From 1966 to 1976, the turbulent period of political and social chaos within China known as the Cultural Revolution led to greater economic and educational decline, with millions being purged or subjected to either persecution or \" politicide \" based on political categories . Since then, the Chinese government has rebuked some of the earlier Maoist policies, conducting a series of political and economic reforms since 1978 that have greatly raised Chinese standards of living, and increased life expectancies.\nChina is currently governed as a unitary\nMarxist–Leninist\none-party\nsocialist republic by the CCP. China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a founding member of several multilateral and regional cooperation organizations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , the Silk Road Fund , the New Development Bank , the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation , and the RCEP . It is also a member of the BRICS , the G8+5 , the G20 , the APEC , and the East Asia Summit . It ranks among the lowest in measurements of democracy , civil liberties , government transparency , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , and the human rights of ethnic minorities . The Chinese authorities have been criticized by human rights activists and non-governmental organizations for human rights abuses , including political repression , mass censorship , mass surveillance of their citizens, and violent suppression of protest and dissent .\nMaking up around one-fifth of the world economy, China is the world's largest economy by GDP at purchasing power parity , the second-largest economy by nominal GDP , and the second-wealthiest country . The country is one of the fastest-growing major economies and is the world's largest manufacturer and exporter , as well as the second-largest importer . China is a recognized nuclear-weapon state with the world's largest standing army by military personnel and the second-largest defense budget . China is considered to be a potential superpower due to its high level of innovation, economic potential, growing military strength, and influence in international affairs.\nEtymology\nMain article: Names of China\nChina (today's Guangdong ), Mangi (inland of Xanton ), and Cataio (inland of China and Chequan , and including the capital Cambalu , Xandu , and a marble bridge ) are all shown as separate regions on this 1570 map by Abraham Ortelius .\nThe word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century; however, it was not a word used by the Chinese themselves during this period. Its origin has been traced through Portuguese , Malay , and Persian back to the Sanskrit word Cīna , used in ancient India . [18] \"China\" appears in Richard Eden 's 1555 translation [q] of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese\nexplorer\nDuarte Barbosa . [r] [18] Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian\nChīn ( چین ), which was in turn derived from Sanskrit Cīna ( चीन ). [23]\nCīna was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the Mahābhārata (5th century BCE) and the Laws of Manu (2nd century BCE). [24] In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the word China is derived ultimately from the name of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE). [25] [24] Although usage in Indian sources precedes this dynasty, this derivation is still given in various sources. [26] The origin of the Sanskrit word is a matter of debate, according to the Oxford English Dictionary . [18]\nAlternative suggestions include the names for Yelang and the Jing or Chu state. [24] [27] The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" ( simplified Chinese : 中华人民共和国 ; traditional Chinese : 中華人民共和國 ; pinyin : Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó ). The shorter form is \"China\" Zhōngguó ( 中国 ; 中國 ) from zhōng (\"central\") and guó (\"state\"), [s] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne . [t] [u] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing . [29] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\" . [29] The name Zhongguo is also translated as \"Middle Kingdom\" in English. [32] China (PRC) is sometimes referred to as the Mainland when distinguishing the ROC from the PRC. [33] [34] [35] [36]\nHistory\nMain article: History of China\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Chinese history .\nPrehistory\n10,000-year-old pottery, Xianren Cave culture (18000–7000 BCE)\nChina is regarded as one of the world's oldest civilisations. [37] [38]\nArchaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited the country 2.25 million years ago. [39] The hominid fossils of Peking Man , a Homo erectus who used fire , [40] were discovered in a cave at Zhoukoudian near Beijing ; they have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago . [41] The fossilized teeth of Homo sapiens (dated to 125,000–80,000 years ago) have been discovered in Fuyan Cave in Dao County , Hunan . [42] Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 6600 BCE, [43] at Damaidi around 6000 BCE, [44]\nDadiwan from 5800 to 5400 BCE, and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BCE. Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest Chinese writing system. [43]\nEarly dynastic rule\nFurther information: Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors , Xia dynasty , Shang dynasty , Zhou dynasty , Spring and Autumn period , and Warring States period\nYinxu , the ruins of the capital of the late Shang dynasty (14th century BCE)\nAccording to Chinese tradition, the first dynasty was the Xia , which emerged around 2100 BCE. [45] The Xia dynasty marked the beginning of China's political system based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties , which lasted for a millennium. [46] The Xia dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites at Erlitou , Henan in 1959. [47] It remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the Xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period. [48] The succeeding Shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records. [49] The Shang ruled the plain of the Yellow River in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th century BCE. [50] Their oracle bone script (from c.  1500 BCE) [51] [52] represents the oldest form of Chinese writing yet found [53] and is a direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters . [54]\nThe Shang was conquered by the Zhou , who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries BCE, though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords. Some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou, no longer fully obeyed the Zhou king, and continually waged war with each other during the 300-year Spring and Autumn period . By the time of the Warring States period of the 5th–3rd centuries BCE, there were only seven powerful states left. [55]\nImperial China\nChina's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang , is famed for having united the Warring States ' walls to form the Great Wall of China . Most of the present structure, however, dates to the Ming dynasty .\nThe Warring States period ended in 221 BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six kingdoms, reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy . King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty . He enacted Qin's legalist reforms throughout China, notably the forced standardization of Chinese characters , measurements , road widths (i.e., the cart axles' length), and currency . His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi , Guangdong , and Vietnam . [56] The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death, as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion. [57] [58]\nFollowing a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at Xianyang\nwas burned , [v] the Han dynasty emerged to rule China between 206 BCE and CE 220, creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the Han Chinese . [57] [58] The Han expanded the empire's territory considerably , with military campaigns reaching Central Asia, Mongolia , South Korea , and Yunnan , and the recovery of Guangdong and northern Vietnam from Nanyue . Han involvement in Central Asia and Sogdia helped establish the land route of the Silk Road , replacing the earlier path over the Himalayas to India. Han China gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world. [60] Despite the Han's initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of Confucianism , Qin's legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors. [61]\nMap showing the expansion of Han dynasty in the 2nd century BC\nAfter the end of the Han dynasty , a period of strife known as Three Kingdoms followed, [62] whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the Four Classics of Chinese literature . At its end, Wei was swiftly overthrown by the Jin dynasty . The Jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally disabled emperor ; the Five Barbarians then invaded and ruled northern China as the Sixteen States . The Xianbei unified them as the Northern Wei , whose Emperor Xiaowen reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects , largely integrating them into Chinese culture. In the south, the general Liu Yu secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the Liu Song . The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern dynasties , with the two areas finally reunited by the Sui in 581. The Sui restored the Han to power through China, reformed its agriculture, economy and imperial examination system, constructed the Grand Canal , and patronized Buddhism . However, they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war in northern Korea provoked widespread unrest. [63] [64]\nUnder the succeeding Tang and Song dynasties , Chinese economy, technology, and culture entered a golden age. [65] The Tang dynasty retained control of the Western Regions and the Silk Road, [66] which brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa , [67] and made the capital Chang'an a cosmopolitan urban center. However, it was devastated and weakened by the An Lushan Rebellion in the 8th century. [68] In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable. The Song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960, leading to a balance of power between the Song and Khitan Liao . The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade. [69]\nThe Tang dynasty at its greatest extent and Tang's protectorates\nBetween the 10th and 11th centuries, the population of China doubled in size to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a revival of Confucianism , in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang, [70] and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity. [71] [72] However, the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jurchen\nJin dynasty . In 1127, Emperor Huizong of Song and the capital Bianjing were captured during the Jin–Song Wars . The remnants of the Song retreated to southern China . [73]\nThe Mongol conquest of China began in 1205 with the gradual conquest of Western Xia by Genghis Khan , [74] who also invaded Jin territories . [75] In 1271, the Mongol\nleader\nKublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty , which conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279. Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song China was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300. [76] A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang led a rebellion that overthrew the Yuan in 1368 and founded the Ming dynasty as the Hongwu Emperor . Under the Ming dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that admiral Zheng He led the Ming treasure voyages throughout the Indian Ocean , reaching as far as East Africa . [77]\nThe Qing conquest of the Ming and expansion of the empire\nIn the early years of the Ming dynasty, China's capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing. With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as Wang Yangming further critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations . [78] The scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) and Manchu invasions led to an exhausted treasury. [79] In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng . The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu Qing dynasty , then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui , overthrew Li's short-lived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. [80]\nThe Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. Its conquest of the Ming (1618–1683) cost 25 million lives and the economy of China shrank drastically . [81] After the Southern Ming ended, the further conquest of the Dzungar Khanate added Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang to the empire. [82] The centralized autocracy was strengthened to suppress anti-Qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce, the Haijin (\"sea ban\"), and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition , causing social and technological stagnation. [83] [84]\nFall of the Qing dynasty\nFurther information: Century of humiliation , Opium Wars , First Sino-Japanese War , and Boxer Rebellion\nThe Eight-Nation Alliance invaded China to defeat the anti-foreign Boxers and their Qing backers. The image shows a celebration ceremony inside the Chinese imperial palace, the Forbidden City after the signing of the Boxer Protocol in 1901.\nIn the mid-19th century, the Qing dynasty experienced Western imperialism in the Opium Wars with Britain and France . China was forced to pay compensation, open treaty ports, allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals, and cede Hong Kong to the British [85] under the 1842 Treaty of Nanking , the first of the Unequal Treaties . The First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) resulted in Qing China's loss of influence in the Korean Peninsula , as well as the cession of Taiwan to Japan . [86] The Qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the White Lotus Rebellion , the failed Taiping Rebellion that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) in the northwest. The initial success of the Self-Strengthening Movement of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s. [ citation needed ]\nIn the 19th century, the great Chinese diaspora began. Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–1879 , in which between 9 and 13 million people died. [87] The Guangxu Emperor drafted a reform plan in 1898 to establish a modern constitutional monarchy , but these plans were thwarted by the Empress Dowager Cixi . The ill-fated anti-foreign Boxer Rebellion of 1899–1901 further weakened the dynasty. Although Cixi sponsored a program of reforms, the Xinhai Revolution of 1911–1912 brought an end to the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China . [88]\nPuyi , the last Emperor of China, abdicated in 1912. [89]\nEstablishment of the Republic and World War II\nMain article: Republic of China (1912–1949)\nFurther information: 1911 Revolution , Second Sino-Japanese War , Chinese Civil War , and Chinese Communist Revolution\nSun Yat-sen , the founding father of Republic of China , one of the first republics in Asia\nOn 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established, and Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed provisional president. [90] On 12 February 1912, regent\nEmpress Dowager Longyu sealed the imperial abdication decree on behalf of 4 year old Puyi , the last emperor of China, ending 5,000 years of monarchy in China . [91] In March 1912, the presidency was given to Yuan Shikai , a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself Emperor of China . In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own Beiyang Army , he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic in 1916. [92]\nAfter Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its territory. [93] [94] In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek , the then Principal of the Republic of China Military Academy , was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political maneuverings, known collectively as the Northern Expedition . [95] [96] The Kuomintang moved the nation's capital to Nanjing and implemented \"political tutelage\", an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's San-min program for transforming China into a modern democratic state. [97] [98] The political division in China made it difficult for Chiang to battle the communist -led People's Liberation Army (PLA), against whom the Kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in the Chinese Civil War . This war continued successfully for the Kuomintang, especially after the PLA retreated in the Long March , until Japanese aggression and the 1936 Xi'an Incident forced Chiang to confront Imperial Japan . [99]\nChiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong toasting together in 1945 following the end of World War II\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), a theater of World War II , forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population; in all, as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died. [100] An estimated 40,000 to 300,000 Chinese were massacred in the city of Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation. [101] During the war, China, along with the UK, the United States, and the Soviet Union , were referred to as \"trusteeship of the powerful\" [102] and were recognized as the Allied \" Big Four \" in the Declaration by United Nations . [103] [104] Along with the other three great powers, China was one of the four major Allies of World War II , and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war. [105] [106] After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Taiwan, including the Pescadores , was handed over to Chinese control . However, the validity of this handover is controversial, in that whether Taiwan's sovereignty was legally transferred and whether China is a legitimate recipient, due to complex issues that arose from the handling of Japan's surrender, resulting in the unresolved political status of Taiwan , which is a flashpoint of potential war between China and Taiwan. China emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war. Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing unrest, many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China. [107]\nCivil War and the People's Republic\nMain article: History of the People's Republic of China\nFurther information: Chinese Soviet Republic ; Proclamation of the People's Republic of China ; Retreat of the government of the Republic of China to Taiwan ; Taiwan, China ; and Cultural Revolution\nBefore the existence of the People's Republic, the CCP had declared several areas of the country as the Chinese Soviet Republic (Jiangxi Soviet), a predecessor state to the PRC, in November 1931 in Ruijin , Jiangxi . The Jiangxi Soviet was wiped out by the KMT armies in 1934 and was relocated to Yan'an in Shaanxi where the Long March concluded in 1935. [108] [ failed verification ] It would be the base of the communists before major combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949. Afterwards, the CCP took control of most of mainland China , and the Kuomintang retreating offshore to Taiwan , reducing its territory to only Taiwan , Hainan , and their surrounding islands.\nThe founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China was held at 3:00 pm on October 1, 1949. The picture above shows Mao Zedong 's announcement of the founding of the People's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square . [109]\nOn 1 October 1949, CCP Chairman\nMao Zedong formally proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China at the new nation's founding ceremony and inaugural military parade in Tiananmen Square , Beijing. [110] [111] In 1950, the People's Liberation Army captured Hainan from the ROC [112] and annexed Tibet . [113] However, remaining Kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the 1950s. [114]\nThe government consolidated its popularity among the peasants through land reform, which included the execution of between 1 and 2 million landlords . [115] China developed an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons . [116] The Chinese population increased from 550 million in 1950 to 900 million in 1974. [117] However, the Great Leap Forward , an idealistic massive reform project, resulted in an estimated 15 to 55 million deaths between 1959 and 1961, mostly from starvation. [118] [119] In 1964, China's first atomic bomb exploded successfully. [120] In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the Cultural Revolution , sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval that lasted until Mao's death in 1976. In October 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China in the United Nations, and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council. [121] This UN action also created the problem of the political status of Taiwan and the Two Chinas issue.\nReforms and contemporary history\nFurther information: Chinese economic reform\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square protests was ended by a military-led massacre which brought condemnations and sanctions against the Chinese government from various foreign countries.\nAfter Mao's death, the Gang of Four was quickly arrested by Hua Guofeng and held responsible for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978, and instituted significant economic reforms . The CCP loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives, and the communes were gradually disbanded in favor of working contracted to households. Agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses. [ citation needed ] This marked China's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open-market environment . [122] China adopted its current constitution on 4 December 1982. In 1989, the suppression of student protests in Tiananmen Square brought condemnations and sanctions against the Chinese government from various foreign countries. [123]\nJiang Zemin , Li Peng and Zhu Rongji led the nation in the 1990s. Under their administration, China's economic performance pulled an estimated [ by whom? ] 150 million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2%. [124] [ better source needed ]\nBritish Hong Kong and Portuguese Macau returned to China in 1997 and 1999 , respectively, as the Hong Kong and Macau\nspecial administrative regions under the principle of One country, two systems . The country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and maintained its high rate of economic growth under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao 's leadership in the 2000s. However, the growth also severely impacted the country's resources and environment, [125] [126] and caused major social displacement . [127] [128]\nBelt and Road Initiative and related projects.\nCCP general secretary\nXi Jinping has ruled since 2012 and has pursued large-scale efforts to reform China's economy [129] [130] (which has suffered from structural instabilities and slowing growth), [131] [132] [133] and has also reformed the one-child policy and penal system , [134] as well as instituting a vast anti-corruption crackdown . [135] In the early 2010s, China's economic growth rate began to slow amid domestic credit troubles, weakening international demand for Chinese exports and fragility in the global economy. [136] [137] [138] In 2013, China initiated the Belt and Road Initiative , a global infrastructure investment project. [139] Since 2017, the Chinese government has been engaged in a harsh crackdown in Xinjiang, with an estimated one million people, mostly Uyghurs but including other ethnic and religious minorities, in internment camps. [140] The National People's Congress in 2018 altered the country's constitution to remove the two-term limit on holding the Presidency of China, permitting the current leader, Xi Jinping , to remain president of China (and general secretary of the CCP) for an unlimited time, earning criticism for creating dictatorial governance. [141] [142] In 2020, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) passed a national security law in Hong Kong that gave the Hong Kong government wide-ranging tools to crack down on dissent. [143] In December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic began with an outbreak in Wuhan ; after three years of strict public health measures indented to completely eradicate the virus, mounting social and economic pressures compelled the government to loosen restrictions in December 2022.\nGeography\nMain article: Geography of China\nChina topographic map with East Asia countries\nChina's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the arid north to the subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya , Karakoram , Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia . The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 km (9,000 mi) long and is bounded by the Bohai , Yellow , East China and South China seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian Steppe which has been an artery of communication between East and West since the Neolithic through the Steppe Route – the ancestor of the terrestrial Silk Road (s). [ citation needed ]\nThe territory of China lies between latitudes\n18° and 54° N , and longitudes\n73° and 135° E . The geographical center of China is marked by the Center of the Country Monument at 35°50′40.9″N\n103°27′7.5″E ﻿ / ﻿ 35.844694°N 103.452083°E ﻿ / 35.844694; 103.452083 ﻿ ( Geographical center of China ) . China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains , while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi , Mekong , Brahmaputra and Amur . To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert. The world's highest point, Mount Everest (8,848 m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border. [144] The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of Ayding Lake (−154 m) in the Turpan Depression . [145]\nClimate\nMain article: Climate of China\nFurther information: Great Green Wall (China)\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification map for mainland China [146]\nChina's climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons , which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist. [147]\nA major environmental issue in China is the continued expansion of its deserts , particularly the Gobi Desert. [148] [149] Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms , prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of East Asia, including Japan and Korea. China's environmental watchdog, SEPA , stated in 2007 that China is losing 4,000 km 2 (1,500 sq mi) per year to desertification. [150] Water quality, erosion , and pollution control have become important issues in China's relations with other countries. Melting glaciers in the Himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people. [151] According to academics, in order to limit climate change in China to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) electricity generation from coal in China without carbon capture must be phased out by 2045. [152] Official government statistics about Chinese agricultural productivity are considered unreliable, due to exaggeration of production at subsidiary government levels. [153] [154] Much of China has a climate very suitable for agriculture and the country has been the world's largest producer of rice , wheat, tomatoes, eggplant, grapes, watermelon, spinach, and many other crops. [155]\nBiodiversity\nMain article: Wildlife of China\nA giant panda , China's most famous endangered and endemic species, at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in Sichuan\nChina is one of 17 megadiverse countries , [156] lying in two of the world's major biogeographic realms : the Palearctic and the Indomalayan . By one measure, China has over 34,687 species of animals and vascular plants, making it the third-most biodiverse country in the world, after Brazil and Colombia . [157] The country signed the Rio de Janeiro\nConvention on Biological Diversity on 11 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 5 January 1993. [158] It later produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan , with one revision that was received by the convention on 21 September 2010. [159]\nChina is home to at least 551 species of mammals (the third-highest such number in the world), [160] 1,221 species of birds (eighth), [161] 424 species of reptiles (seventh) [162] and 333 species of amphibians (seventh). [163] Wildlife in China shares habitat with, and bears acute pressure from, the world's largest population of humans. At least 840 animal species are threatened, vulnerable or in danger of local extinction in China, due mainly to human activity such as habitat destruction, pollution and poaching for food, fur and ingredients for traditional Chinese medicine . [164] Endangered wildlife is protected by law, and as of 2005 [update] , the country has over 2,349 nature reserves , covering a total area of 149.95 million hectares, 15 percent of China's total land area. [165] [ better source needed ] Most wild animals have been eliminated from the core agricultural regions of east and central China, but they have fared better in the mountainous south and west. [166] [167] The Baiji was confirmed extinct on 12 December 2006. [168]\nChina has over 32,000 species of vascular plants, [169] and is home to a variety of forest types. Cold coniferous forests predominate in the north of the country, supporting animal species such as moose and Asian black bear , along with over 120 bird species. [170] The understory of moist conifer forests may contain thickets of bamboo . In higher montane stands of juniper and yew , the bamboo is replaced by rhododendrons . Subtropical forests, which are predominate in central and southern China, support a high density of plant species including numerous rare endemics. Tropical and seasonal rainforests , though confined to Yunnan and Hainan Island , contain a quarter of all the animal and plant species found in China. [170] China has over 10,000 recorded species of fungi , [171] and of them, nearly 6,000 are higher fungi .\nEnvironment\nMain articles: Environment of China and Environmental issues in China\nSee also: Renewable energy in China , Water resources of China , Energy policy of China , and Climate change in China\nThe Three Gorges Dam is the largest hydroelectric dam in the world.\nIn the early 2000s, China has suffered from environmental deterioration and pollution due to its rapid pace of industrialization. [172] [173] While regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent, they are poorly enforced, as they are frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favor of rapid economic development. [174] China is the country with the second highest death toll because of air pollution, after India . There are approximately 1 million deaths caused by exposure to ambient air pollution. [175] [176] Although China ranks as the highest CO 2 emitting country in the world, [177] it only emits 8 tons of CO 2 per capita , significantly lower than developed countries such as the United States (16.1), Australia (16.8) and South Korea (13.6). [178]\nIn recent years, China has clamped down on pollution. In March 2014, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping \"declared war\" on pollution during the opening of the National People's Congress . [179] After extensive debate lasting nearly two years, the parliament approved a new environmental law in April. The new law empowers environmental enforcement agencies with great punitive power and large fines for offenders, defines areas which require extra protection, and gives independent environmental groups more ability to operate in the country. [ citation needed ] In 2020, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping announced that China aims to peak emissions before 2030 and go carbon-neutral by 2060 in accordance with the Paris climate accord . [180] According to Climate Action Tracker , if accomplished it would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2 – 0.3 degrees – \"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\". [181] In September 2021 Xi Jinping announced that China will not build \"coal-fired power projects abroad\". The decision can be \"pivotal\" in reducing emissions. The Belt and Road Initiative did not include financing such projects already in the first half of 2021. [182]\nThe country also had significant water pollution problems: 8.2% of China's rivers had been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste in 2019. [183] [184] China had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.14/10, ranking it 53rd globally out of 172 countries. [185] In 2020, a sweeping law was passed by the Chinese government to protect the ecology of the Yangtze River. The new laws include strengthening ecological protection rules for hydropower projects along the river, banning chemical plants within 1 kilometer of the river, relocating polluting industries, severely restricting sand mining as well as a complete fishing ban on all the natural waterways of the river, including all its major tributaries and lakes. [186]\nChina is also the world's leading investor in renewable energy and its commercialization , with $ 52 billion invested in 2011 alone; [187] [188] [189] it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects. [190] [191] [192] By 2015, over 24% of China's energy was derived from renewable sources, while most notably from hydroelectric power : a total installed capacity of 197 GW makes China the largest hydroelectric power producer in the world. [193] [194] China also has the largest power capacity of installed solar photovoltaics system and wind power system in the world. [195] [196]\nGreenhouse gas emissions by China are the world's largest , [178] as is renewable energy in China . [197] Despite its emphasis on renewables, China remains deeply connected to global oil markets and next to India, has been the largest importer of Russian crude oil in 2022.

It is narrowly separated from Bangladesh and Thailand to the southwest and south, and has several maritime neighbors such as Japan , Philippines , Malaysia , and Indonesia . [202]\nPolitics\nMain article: Politics of China\nSee also: List of current Chinese provincial leaders\nThe Great Hall of the People where the National People's Congress convenes\nThe Zhongnanhai , headquarters of the Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party\nThe Chinese constitution states that the People's Republic of China \"is a socialist state governed by a people's democratic dictatorship that is led by the working class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants,\" and that the state institutions \"shall practice the principle of democratic centralism .\" [203] The PRC is one of the world's only socialist states\ngoverned by a communist party . The Chinese government has been variously described as communist and socialist, but also as authoritarian [204] and corporatist , [205] with amongst the heaviest restrictions worldwide in many areas, most notably against free access to the Internet , freedom of the press , freedom of assembly , the right to have children , free formation of social organizations and freedom of religion . [206]\nAlthough the Chinese Communist Party describes China as a \"socialist consultative democracy\", [207] the country is commonly described as an authoritarian one-party\nsurveillance state and a dictatorship . [208] [209] China has consistently been ranked amongst the lowest as an \"authoritarian regime\" by the Economist Intelligence Unit 's Democracy Index , ranking at 156th out of 167 countries in 2022. [210] Its current political, ideological and economic system has been termed by its leaders as a \" whole-process people's democracy \" \" people's democratic dictatorship \", \" socialism with Chinese characteristics \" (which is Marxism adapted to Chinese circumstances) and the \" socialist market economy \" respectively. [211] [212]\nPolitical concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption. [213] Nonetheless, the level of public support for the government and its management of the nation is high, with 80–95% of Chinese citizens expressing satisfaction with the central government, according to a 2011 Harvard University survey. [214] A 2020 survey from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research also had most Chinese expressing satisfaction with the government on information dissemination and delivery of daily necessities during the COVID-19 pandemic. [215] [216] A Harvard University survey published in July 2020 found that citizen satisfaction with the government had increased since 2003, also rating China's government as more effective and capable than ever before in the survey's history. [217]\nChinese Communist Party\nMain article: Chinese Communist Party\nThe Chinese Communist Party is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China.\nThe main body of the Chinese constitution declares that \"the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\" [218] China is a one-party Marxist–Leninist state, [219] wherein the CCP general secretary ( party leader ) holds ultimate power and authority over state and government and serves as the informal paramount leader . [220] The current general secretary is Xi Jinping , who took office on 15 November 2012, and was re-elected on 25 October 2017. [221] According to the CCP constitution , its highest body is the National Congress held every five years. [222] The National Congress elects the Central Committee , who then elects the party's Politburo , Politburo Standing Committee and general secretary, the top leadership of the country. [222] At the local level, the secretary of the CCP committee of a subdivision outranks the local government level; CCP committee secretary of a provincial division outranks the governor while the CCP committee secretary of a city outranks the mayor. [223]\nSince both the CCP and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) promote according to seniority, it is possible to discern distinct generations of Chinese leadership . [224] In official discourse, each group of leadership is identified with a distinct extension of the ideology of the party. Historians have studied various periods in the development of the government of the People's Republic of China by reference to these \"generations\".\nGenerations of Chinese leadership\nGeneration\nParamount Leader\nStart\nEnd\nIdeology\nFirst\nMao Zedong Hua Guofeng\n1949\n1978\nMao Zedong Thought\nSecond\nDeng Xiaoping\n1978\n1989\nDeng Xiaoping Theory\nThird\nJiang Zemin\n1989\n2002\nThree Represents\nFourth\nHu Jintao\n2002\n2012\nScientific Outlook on Development\nFifth\nXi Jinping\n2012\nXi Jinping Thought\nGovernment\nMain article: Government of China\nSee also: List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China\nXi Jinping CCP General Secretary and President\nLi Qiang Premier\nZhao Leji Congress Chairman\nWang Huning CPPCC Chairman\nThe nearly 3,000 member National People's Congress (NPC) is constitutionally the \"highest state organ of power\", [203] though it has been also described as a \" rubber stamp \" body. [225] The NPC meets annually, while the NPC Standing Committee , around 150 member body elected from NPC delegates, meets every couple of months. [225] In what China calls the \" people's congress system \", local people's congresses at the lowest level [z] are officially directly elected, with all the higher-level people's congresses up to the NPC being elected by the level one below. [203] However, the elections are not pluralistic, with nominations at all levels being controlled by the CCP. [226] The NPC is dominated by the CCP, with another eight minor parties having nominal representation in the condition of upholding CCP leadership. [227]\nThe president is the ceremonial head of state , elected by the NPC. The incumbent president is Xi Jinping, who is also the general secretary of the CCP and the chairman of the Central Military Commission , making him China's paramount leader . The premier is the head of government , with Li Qiang being the incumbent premier. The premier is officially nominated by the president and then elected by the NPC, and has generally been either the second or third-ranking member of the PSC. The premier presides over the State Council , China's cabinet, composed of four vice premiers and the heads of ministries and commissions. [203] The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is a political advisory body that is critical in China's \" united front \" system, which aims to gather non-CCP voices to support the CCP. Similar to the people's congresses, CPPCC's exist at various division, with the National Committee of the CPPCC being chaired by Wang Huning , one of China's top leaders. [228]\nAdministrative divisions\nMain articles: Administrative divisions of China , Districts of Hong Kong , and Municipalities and parishes of Macau\nThe People's Republic of China is constitutionally a unitary state officially divided into 23 provinces , [n] five autonomous regions (each with a designated minority group), and four municipalities —collectively referred to as \" mainland China \"—as well as the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau . [229] The PRC considers Taiwan to be its 23rd province , [230] although it is governed by the Republic of China (ROC), which claims to be the legitimate representative of China and its territory, though it has downplayed this claim since its democratization. [231] Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions: North China , Northeast China , East China , South Central China , Southwest China , and Northwest China .

Since 2019, China has the largest diplomatic network in the world. [233] [234] In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China (ROC) as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council . [235] China was also a former member and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement , and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries . [236] Along with Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, China is a member of the BRICS group of emerging major economies and hosted the group's third official summit at Sanya , Hainan in April 2011. [237]\nMany other countries have switched recognition from the ROC to the PRC since the latter replaced the former in the United Nations in 1971. [238] The PRC officially maintains the one-China principle , which holds the view that there is only one sovereign state in the name of China, represented by the PRC, and that Taiwan is part of that China. [239] The unique status of Taiwan has led to countries recognizing the PRC to maintain unique \"one-China policies\" that differ from each other; some countries explicitly recognize the PRC's claim over Taiwan, while others, including the US and Japan, only acknowledge the claim. [239] Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan, [240] especially in the matter of armament sales. [241]\nMuch of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier Zhou Enlai 's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , and is also driven by the concept of \"harmony without uniformity\", which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences. [242] This policy may have led China to support or maintain close ties with states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by Western nations, such as Myanmar , [243]\nNorth Korea and Iran . [244] China has a close political, economic and military relationship with Russia, [245] and the two states often vote in unison in the United Nations Security Council . [246] [247] [248]\nTrade relations\nOn 21 May 2014, China and Russia signed a $400 billion gas deal . Currently, Russia is supplying natural gas to China.\nChina became the world's largest trading nation in 2013 as measured by the sum of imports and exports, as well as the world's largest commodity importer. comprising roughly 45% of maritime's dry-bulk market . [249] [250] By 2016, China was the largest trading partner of 124 other countries. [251] China is the largest trading partner for the ASEAN nations, with a total trade value of $345.8 billion in 2015 accounting for 15.2% of ASEAN's total trade. [252] ASEAN is also China's largest trading partner. [253] In 2020, China became the largest trading partner of the European Union for goods, with the total value of goods trade reaching nearly $700 billion. [254] China, along with ASEAN, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, is a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership , the world's largest free-trade area covering 30% of the world's population and economic output. [255] China became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. In 2004, it proposed an entirely new East Asia Summit (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues. [256] The EAS, which includes ASEAN Plus Three , India, Australia and New Zealand, held its inaugural summit in 2005. [257]\nChina has had a long and complex trade relationship with the United States. In 2000, the United States Congress approved \"permanent normal trade relations\" (PNTR) with China, allowing Chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries. [258] China has a significant trade surplus with the United States, its most important export market. [259] Economists have argued that the renminbi is undervalued, due to currency intervention from the Chinese government, giving China an unfair trade advantage. [260] In August 2019, the United States Department of the Treasury designated China as a \" currency manipulator \", [261] later reversing the decision in January 2020. [262] The US and other foreign governments have also alleged that China doesn't respect intellectual property (IP) rights and steals IP through espionage operations , [263] [264] with the US Department of Justice saying that 80% of all the prosecutions related to economic espionage it brings were about conduct to benefit the Chinese state. [265]\nSince the turn of the century, China has followed a policy of engaging with African nations for trade and bilateral co-operation; [266] [267] [268] in 2019, Sino-African trade totalled $208 billion, having grown 20 times over two decades. [269] According to Madison Condon \"China finances more infrastructure projects in Africa than the World Bank and provides billions of dollars in low-interest loans to the continent's emerging economies.\" [270] China maintains extensive and highly diversified trade links with the European Union. [254] China has furthermore strengthened its trade ties with major South American economies, [271] and is the largest trading partner of Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Argentina, and several others. [272]\nChina's Belt and Road Initiative has expanded significantly over the last six years and, as of April 2020, includes 138 countries and 30 international organizations. In addition to intensifying foreign policy relations, the focus here is particularly on building efficient transport routes. The focus is particularly on the maritime Silk Road with its connections to East Africa and Europe and there are Chinese investments or related declarations of intent at numerous ports such as Gwadar , Kuantan , Hambantota , Piraeus and Trieste . However many of these loans made under the Belt and Road program are unsustainable and China has faced a number of calls for debt relief from debtor nations. [273] [274]\nTerritorial disputes\nMain article: Territorial disputes of the People's Republic of China\nSee also: List of wars involving the People's Republic of China and Cross-Strait relations\nTaiwan\nMap depicting territorial disputes between the PRC and neighboring states. For a larger map, see here .\nEver since its establishment after the Chinese Civil War, the PRC has claimed the territories governed by the Republic of China (ROC), a separate political entity today commonly known as Taiwan, as a part of its territory. It regards the island of Taiwan as its Taiwan Province , Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province and Guangdong Province . These claims are controversial because of the complicated Cross-Strait relations , with the PRC treating the One-China Principle as one of its most important diplomatic principles. [275] [ better source needed ]\nLand border disputes\nFurther information: Sino-Indian border dispute\nChina has resolved its land borders with 12 out of 14 neighboring countries, having pursued substantial compromises in most of them. [276] [277] [278] As of 2023, China currently has a disputed land border with India and Bhutan . [ citation needed ]\nMaritime border disputes\nMain articles: Territorial disputes in the South China Sea and Senkaku Islands dispute\nChina is additionally involved in maritime disputes with multiple countries over the ownership of several small islands in the East and South China Seas, such as Socotra Rock , the Senkaku Islands and the entirety of South China Sea Islands , [279] [280] along with the EEZ disputes over East China Sea .\nSociopolitical issues and human rights\nSee also: Human rights in China , Hukou , Social welfare in China , Elections in China , Censorship in China , and Uyghur genocide\nMarch in memory of Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo who died of organ failure while in government custody in 2017\nChina uses a massive espionage network of cameras, facial recognition software, sensors, and surveillance of personal technology as a means of social control of persons living in the country. [281] The Chinese democracy movement , social activists, and some members of the CCP [ who? ] believe in the need for social and political reform. While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s, political freedom is still tightly restricted. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China states that the \"fundamental rights\" of citizens include freedom of speech , freedom of the press , the right to a fair trial , freedom of religion , universal suffrage , and property rights . However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state. [282] [283] Although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling CCP are tolerated, censorship of political speech and information, most notably on the Internet, [284] [285] are routinely used to prevent collective action. [286]\nA number of foreign governments, foreign press agencies, and non-governmental organizations have criticized China's human rights record , alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial, forced abortions , [287] forced confessions, torture , restrictions of fundamental rights, [206] [288] and excessive use of the death penalty . [289] [290] The government suppresses popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to \"social stability\", as was the case with the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre . [291]\nIn Xinjiang , China has been accused of committing genocide against Uyghurs and detaining more than one million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in camps. [292]\nChina is regularly accused of large-scale repression and human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang , [293] [294] [295] including violent police crackdowns and religious suppression . [296] [297] In Xinjiang, at least one million Uyghurs and other ethnic and religion minorities have been detained in internment camps , officially termed \"Vocational Education and Training Centers\", aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees, their identities, and their religious beliefs. [140] According to the U.S. Department of State , actions including political indoctrination , torture , physical and psychological abuse, forced sterilization , sexual abuse , and forced labor are common in these facilities. [298] The state has also sought to control offshore reporting of tensions in Xinjiang, intimidating foreign-based reporters by detaining their family members. [299] According to a 2020 report, China's treatment of Uyghurs meets the UN definition of genocide, [300] and several groups called for a UN investigation. [301] Several countries have recognized China's actions in Xinjiang as a genocide. [302] [292] [303]\n2019–20 Hong Kong protests\nGlobal studies from Pew Research Center in 2014 and 2017 ranked the Chinese government's restrictions on religion as among the highest in the world, despite low to moderate rankings for religious-related social hostilities in the country. [304] [305] The Global Slavery Index estimated that in 2016 more than 3.8 million people were living in \"conditions of modern slavery \", or 0.25% of the population, including victims of human trafficking, forced labor, forced marriage, child labor, and state-imposed forced labor. The state-imposed forced system was formally abolished in 2013, but it is not clear to which extent its various practices have stopped. [306] The Chinese penal system includes labor prison factories, detention centers, and re-education camps, collectively known as laogai (\"reform through labor\"). The Laogai Research Foundation in the United States estimated that there were over a thousand slave labor prisons and camps in China. [307]\nMilitary\nMain articles: People's Liberation Army and Paramilitary forces of China\nChengdu J-20\n5th generation stealth fighter\nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) is considered one of the world's most powerful militaries and has rapidly modernized in the recent decades. [308] It consists of the Ground Force (PLAGF), the Navy (PLAN), the Air Force (PLAAF), the Rocket Force (PLARF) and the Strategic Support Force (PLASSF). Its nearly 2.2 million active duty personnel is the largest in the world . The PLA holds the world's third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons , [309] [310] and the world's second-largest navy by tonnage. [311] China's official military budget for 2022 totalled US$230 billion (1.45 trillion Yuan), the second-largest in the world . According to SIPRI estimates, its military spending from 2012 to 2021 averaged US$215 billion per year or 1.7 per cent of GDP, behind only the United States at US$734 billion per year or 3.6 per cent of GDP. [312] The PLA is commanded by the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the party and the state; though officially two separate organizations, the two CMCs have identical membership except during leadership transition periods and effectively function as one organization. The chairman of the CMC is the commander-in-chief of the PLA, with the officeholder also generally being the CCP general secretary, making them the paramount leader of China. [313]\nEconomy\nMain article: Economy of China\nFor Economic history of China, see Economic history of China before 1912 , Economic history of China (1912–1949) , and Economic history of China (1949–present) .\nA proportional representation of Chinese exports, 2019\nChina has the world's second-largest economy in terms of nominal GDP, [314] and the world's largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). [315] As of 2021, China accounts for around 18% of the world economy by GDP nominal. [316] China is one of the world's fastest-growing major economies, [317] with its economic growth having been consistently above 6 percent since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978 . [318] According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $17.73 trillion by 2021. [319] Of the world's 500 largest companies , 145 are headquartered in China. [320]\nChina was one of the world's most most foremost economic powers throughout the arc of East Asian and global history . The country had one of the largest economies in the world for most of the past two millennia , [321] during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline. [322] [323] Since economic reforms began in 1978, China has developed into a highly diversified economy and one of the most consequential players in international trade. Major sectors of competitive strength include manufacturing, retail, mining, steel, textiles, automobiles, energy generation, green energy, banking, electronics, telecommunications, real estate, e-commerce, and tourism. China has three out of the ten largest stock exchanges in the world [324] — Shanghai , Hong Kong and Shenzhen —that together have a market capitalization of over $15.9 trillion, as of October 2020. [325] China has four ( Shanghai , Hong Kong , Beijing , and Shenzhen ) out of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers, which is more than any country in the 2020 Global Financial Centres Index . [326] By 2035, China's four cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen) are projected to be among the global top ten largest cities by nominal GDP according to a report by Oxford Economics. [327]\nChina and other major developing economies by GDP per capita at purchasing-power parity , 1990–2013. The rapid economic growth of China (blue) is readily apparent. [328]\nModern-day China is often described as an example of state capitalism or party-state capitalism . [329] [330] In 1992, Jiang Zemin termed the country a socialist market economy . [331] Others have described it as a form of Marxism–Leninism adapted to co-exist with global capitalism. [332] The state dominates in strategic \"pillar\" sectors such as energy production and heavy industries , but private enterprise has expanded enormously, with around 30 million private businesses recorded in 2008. [333] [334] [335] In 2018, private enterprises in China accounted for 60% of GDP, 80% of urban employment and 90% of new jobs. [336] [ better source needed ]\nChina has been the world's No. 1 manufacturer since 2010, after overtaking the US, which had been No. 1 for the previous hundred years. [337] [338] China has also been No. 2 in high-tech manufacturing since 2012, according to US National Science Foundation . [339] China is the second largest retail market in the world, next to the United States. [340] China leads the world in e-commerce, accounting for 40% of the global market share in 2016 [341] and more than 50% of the global market share in 2019. [342] China is the world's leader in electric vehicles, manufacturing and buying half of all the plug-in electric cars (BEV and PHEV) in the world in 2018. [343] China is also the leading producer of batteries for electric vehicles as well as several key raw materials for batteries. [344] China had 174 GW of installed solar capacity by the end of 2018, which amounts to more than 40% of the global solar capacity. [345] [346]\nWealth\nSee also: Income inequality in China\nShanghai World Financial Center , Jin Mao Tower and Shanghai Tower, Lujiazui\nChina accounted for 17.9% of the world's total wealth in 2021, second highest in the world after the US. [347] It ranks at 65th at GDP (nominal) per capita , making it an upper-middle income country. [348] China brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history [349] [350] —between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million. China reduced the extreme poverty rate—per international standard, it refers to an income of less than $1.90/day—from 88% in 1981 to 1.85% by 2013. [351] The portion of people in China living below the international poverty line of $1.90 per day (2011 PPP ) fell to 0.3% in 2018 from 66.3% in 1990. Using the lower-middle income poverty line of $3.20 per day, the portion fell to 2.9% in 2018 from 90.0% in 1990. Using the upper-middle income poverty line of $5.50 per day, the portion fell to 17.0% from 98.3% in 1990. [352]\nFrom 1978 to 2018, the average standard of living multiplied by a factor of twenty-six. [353] Wages in China have grown a lot in the last 40 years—real (inflation-adjusted) wages grew seven-fold from 1978 to 2007. [354] Per capita incomes have risen significantly – when the PRC was founded in 1949, per capita income in China was one-fifth of the world average; per capita incomes now equal the world average itself. [353] China's development is highly uneven. Its major cities and coastal areas are far more prosperous compared to rural and interior regions. [355] It has a high level of economic inequality, [356] which has increased in the past few decades. [357] In 2018 China's Gini coefficient was 0.467, according to the World Bank . [11]\nAs of 2020, China was second in the world, after the US, in total number of billionaires and total number of millionaires, with 698 Chinese billionaires and 4.4 million millionaires. [358] In 2019, China overtook the US as the home to the highest number of people who have a net personal wealth of at least $110,000, according to the global wealth report by Credit Suisse . [359] [360] According to the Hurun Global Rich List 2020, China is home to five of the world's top ten cities ( Beijing , Shanghai , Hong Kong , Shenzhen , and Guangzhou in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 10th spots, respectively) by the highest number of billionaires, which is more than any other country. [361] China had 85 female billionaires as of January 2021, two-thirds of the global total, and minted 24 new female billionaires in 2020. [362] China has had the world's largest middle-class population since 2015, [363] and the middle-class grew to a size of 400 million by 2018. [364]\nChina in the global economy\nLargest economies by nominal GDP in 2022 [365]\nChina is a member of the WTO and is the world's largest trading power, with a total international trade value of US$4.62 trillion in 2018. [366] China is the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods. [367]\nIts foreign exchange reserves reached US$3.1 trillion as of 2019, [368] making its reserves by far the world's largest. [369] [370] In 2012, China was the world's largest recipient of inward foreign direct investment (FDI), attracting $253 billion. [371] In 2014, China's foreign exchange remittances were $US64 billion making it the second largest recipient of remittances in the world. [372] China also invests abroad, with a total outward FDI of $62.4 billion in 2012, [371] and a number of major takeovers of foreign firms by Chinese companies. [373] China is a major owner of US public debt , holding trillions of dollars worth of U.S. Treasury bonds . [374] [375] China's undervalued exchange rate has caused friction with other major economies, [376] and it has also been widely criticized for manufacturing large quantities of counterfeit goods. [377] [378]\nFollowing the 2007–08 financial crisis, Chinese authorities sought to actively wean off of its dependence on the U.S. dollar as a result of perceived weaknesses of the international monetary system. [379] To achieve those ends, China took a series of actions to further the internationalization of the Renminbi . In 2008, China established the dim sum bond market and expanded the Cross-Border Trade RMB Settlement Pilot Project, which helps establish pools of offshore RMB liquidity. [380] [381] This was followed with bilateral agreements to settle trades directly in renminbi with Russia, [382]\nJapan , [383]\nAustralia , [384]\nSingapore , [385] the United Kingdom , [386] and Canada . [387] As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, it became the eighth-most-traded currency in the world by 2018, an emerging international reserve currency , [388] and a component of the IMF's special drawing rights ; however, partly due to capital controls that make the renminbi fall short of being a fully convertible currency, it remains far behind the Euro, Dollar and Japanese Yen in international trade volumes. [389] As of 2022, Yuan is the world's fifth-most traded currency. [390]\nScience and technology\nMain articles: Science and technology in China , List of Chinese discoveries , and List of Chinese inventions\nHistorical\nMain article: History of science and technology in China\nEarliest known written formula for gunpowder, from the Wujing Zongyao of 1044 CE\nChina was a world leader in science and technology until the Ming dynasty . [391] Ancient Chinese discoveries and inventions , such as papermaking , printing , the compass , and gunpowder (the Four Great Inventions ), became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers . [392] [393] By the 17th century, the Western hemisphere surpassed China in scientific and technological advancement. [394] The causes of this early modern Great Divergence continue to be debated by scholars. [395]\nAfter repeated military defeats by the European colonial powers and Japan in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the Self-Strengthening Movement . After the Communists came to power in 1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the Soviet Union , in which scientific research was part of central planning. [396] After Mao's death in 1976, science and technology were promoted as one of the Four Modernizations , [397] and the Soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformed. [398]\nModern era\nHeadquarters of Tencent in Shenzhen , one of the largest technology and entertainment companies in the world [399]\nSince the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has made significant investments in scientific research [400] and is quickly catching up with the US in R&D spending. [401] [402] China officially spent around 2.4% of its GDP on R&D in 2020, totaling to around $377.8 billion. [403] According to the World Intellectual Property Indicators , China received more applications than the US did in 2018 and 2019 and ranked first globally in patents, utility models, trademarks, industrial designs, and creative goods exports in 2021. [404] [405] [406] It was ranked 11th in the Global Innovation Index in 2022, a considerable improvement from its rank of 35th in 2013. [407] [408] [409] [410] Chinese supercomputers have been ranked the fastest in the world on a few occasions; [411] however, these supercomputers rely on critical components—namely processors—imported from outside of China. [412] China has also struggled with developing several technologies domestically, such as the most advanced semiconductors and reliable jet engines.

China is one of the only three countries with independent human spaceflight capability.\nChina is developing its education system with an emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) . [415] It became the world's largest publisher of scientific papers in 2016. [416] [417] [418] Chinese-born academicians have won prestigious prizes in the sciences and in mathematics , although most of them had conducted their winning research in Western nations. [aa] [ improper synthesis? ]\nSpace program\nMain article: Chinese space program\nThe Chinese space program started in 1958 with some technology transfers from the Soviet Union. However, it did not launch the nation's first satellite until 1970 with the Dong Fang Hong I , which made China the fifth country to do so independently. [425] In 2003, China became the third country in the world to independently send humans into space with Yang Liwei 's spaceflight aboard Shenzhou 5 . as of 2022 [update] , sixteen Chinese nationals have journeyed into space, including two women. In 2011, China launched its first space station testbed, Tiangong-1 . [426] In 2013, a Chinese robotic rover Yutu successfully touched down on the lunar surface as part of the Chang'e 3 mission. [427] In 2019, China became the first country to land a probe— Chang'e 4 —on the far side of the Moon . [428] In 2020, Chang'e 5 successfully returned moon samples to the Earth, making China the third country to do so independently after the United States and the Soviet Union. [429] In 2021, China became the second nation in history to independently land a rover (Zhurong) on Mars, after the United States. [430] China completed its own modular space station , the Tiangong , in low Earth orbit on 3 November 2022. [431] [432] [433] On 29 November 2022, China performed its first in-orbit crew handover aboard the Tiangong . [434] [435]\nInfrastructure\nAfter a decades-long infrastructural boom, [436] China has produced numerous world-leading infrastructural projects: China has the world's largest bullet train network , [437] the most supertall skyscrapers in the world, [438] the world's largest power plant (the Three Gorges Dam ), [439] the largest energy generation capacity in the world, [440] a global satellite navigation system with the largest number of satellites in the world, [441] and has initiated the Belt and Road Initiative , a large global infrastructure building initiative with funding on the order of $50–100 billion per year. [442] The Belt and Road Initiative could be one of the largest development plans in modern history. [443]\nTelecommunications\nMain article: Telecommunications in China\nInternet penetration rates in China in the context of East Asia and Southeast Asia , 1995–2012\nChina is the largest telecom market in the world and currently has the largest number of active cellphones of any country in the world, with over 1.5 billion subscribers, as of 2018. [444] [ better source needed ] It also has the world's largest number of internet and broadband users , with over 800 million Internet users as of 2018 [update] —equivalent to around 60% of its population—and almost all of them being mobile as well. [445] By 2018, China had more than 1 billion 4G users, accounting for 40% of world's total. [446] China is making rapid advances in 5G —by late 2018, China had started large-scale and commercial 5G trials. [447]\nChina Mobile , China Unicom and China Telecom , are the three large providers of mobile and internet in China. China Telecom alone served more than 145 million broadband subscribers and 300 million mobile users; China Unicom had about 300 million subscribers; and China Mobile, the largest of them all, had 925 million users, as of 2018. [448] Combined, the three operators had over 3.4 million 4G base-stations in China. [449] Several Chinese telecommunications companies, most notably Huawei and ZTE , have been accused of spying for the Chinese military. [450]\nChina has developed its own satellite navigation system, dubbed Beidou , which began offering commercial navigation services across Asia in 2012 [451] as well as global services by the end of 2018. [452] [453] Upon the completion of the 35th Beidou satellite, which was launched into orbit on 23 June 2020, Beidou followed GPS and GLONASS as the third completed global navigation satellite in the world. [454]\nTransport\nMain article: Transport in China\nThe Duge Bridge is the highest bridge in the world .\nSince the late 1990s, China's national road network has been significantly expanded through the creation of a network of national highways and expressways . In 2018, China's highways had reached a total length of 142,500 km (88,500 mi), making it the longest highway system in the world . [455] [ better source needed ] China has the world's largest market for automobiles, having surpassed the United States in both auto sales and production . A side-effect of the rapid growth of China's road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents, [456] though the number of fatalities in traffic accidents fell by 20% from 2007 to 2017. [457] [ better source needed ] In urban areas, bicycles remain a common mode of transport, despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles – as of 2012 [update] , there are approximately 470 million bicycles in China. [458]\nThe Beijing Daxing International Airport features the world's largest single-building airport terminal.\nChina's railways , which are state-owned , are among the busiest in the world , handling a quarter of the world's rail traffic volume on only 6 percent of the world's tracks in 2006. [459] [ better source needed ] As of 2017, the country had 127,000 km (78,914 mi) of railways, the second longest network in the world . [460] The railways strain to meet enormous demand particularly during the Chinese New Year holiday, when the world's largest annual human migration takes place. [461]\nChina's high-speed rail (HSR) system started construction in the early 2000s. By the end of 2020, high speed rail in China had reached 37,900 kilometers (23,550 miles) of dedicated lines alone, making it the longest HSR network in the world . [462] [463] Services on the Beijing–Shanghai , Beijing–Tianjin , and Chengdu–Chongqing Lines reach up to 350 km/h (217 mph), making them the fastest conventional high speed railway services in the world. With an annual ridership of over 2.29 billion passengers in 2019 it is the world's busiest. [464] [ better source needed ] The network includes the Beijing–Guangzhou–Shenzhen High-Speed Railway , the single longest HSR line in the world, and the Beijing–Shanghai High-Speed Railway , which has three of longest railroad bridges in the world . [465] The Shanghai Maglev Train , which reaches 431 km/h (268 mph), is the fastest commercial train service in the world. [466]\nThe Port of Shanghai 's deep water harbor on Yangshan Island in the Hangzhou Bay is the world's busiest container port since 2010.\nSince 2000, the growth of rapid transit systems in Chinese cities has accelerated. [467] As of January 2021 [update] , 44 Chinese cities have urban mass transit systems in operation [468] and 39 more have metro systems approved. [469] As of 2020, China boasts the five longest metro systems in the world with the networks in Shanghai , Beijing , Guangzhou , Chengdu and Shenzhen being the largest.\nThere were approximately 229 airports in 2017 , with around 240 planned by 2020. China has over 2,000 river and seaports , about 130 of which are open to foreign shipping. [470] In 2017, the Ports of Shanghai , Hong Kong , Shenzhen , Ningbo-Zhoushan , Guangzhou , Qingdao and Tianjin ranked in the Top 10 in the world in container traffic and cargo tonnage . [471]\nWater supply and sanitation\nMain article: Water supply and sanitation in China\nWater supply and sanitation infrastructure in China is facing challenges such as rapid urbanization, as well as water scarcity, contamination, and pollution . [472] According to data presented by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF in 2015, about 36% of the rural population in China still did not have access to improved sanitation . [473] The ongoing South–North Water Transfer Project intends to abate water shortage in the north. [474]\nDemographics\nMain article: Demographics of China\nA 2009 population density map of the People's Republic of China, with territories not under its control in blue. The eastern coastal provinces are much more densely populated than the western interior.\nThe national census of 2020 recorded the population of the People's Republic of China as approximately 1,411,778,724. According to the 2020 census, about 17.95% of the population were 14 years old or younger, 63.35% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 18.7% were over 60 years old. [8] The population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46%. [475] China used to make up much of the world's poor; now it makes up much of the world's middle-class. [476] Although a middle-income country by Western standards, China's rapid growth has pulled hundreds of millions —800 million, to be more precise [477] —of its people out of poverty since 1978. By 2013, less than 2% of the Chinese population lived below the international poverty line of US$1.9 per day, down from 88% in 1981. [351] From 2009 to 2018, the unemployment rate in China has averaged about 4%. [478]\nGiven concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family. Beginning in the mid-1980s, however, given the unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions, particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a \"1.5\"-child policy from the mid-1980s to 2015 (ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits). The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child. [479] In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a two-child policy . [480] A three-child policy was announced on 31 May 2021, due to population aging , [481] and in July 2021, all family size limits as well as penalties for exceeding them were removed. [482] According to data from the 2020 census, China's total fertility rate is 1.3, but some experts believe that after adjusting for the transient effects of the relaxation of restrictions, the country's actual total fertility rate is as low as 1.1. [483] In 2023, National Bureau of Statistics estimated that the population fell 850,000 from 2021 to 2022, the first decline since 1961. [484]\nAccording to one group of scholars, one-child limits had little effect on population growth [485] or the size of the total population. [486] However, these scholars have been challenged. Their own counterfactual model of fertility decline without such restrictions implies that China averted more than 500 million births between 1970 and 2015, a number which may reach one billion by 2060 given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility restrictions, with one-child restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that reduction. [487] The policy, along with traditional preference for boys, may have contributed to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth. [488] [489] According to the 2010 census, the sex ratio at birth was 118.06 boys for every 100 girls, [490] which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls. [491] The 2010 census found that males accounted for 51.27 percent of the total population. [490] However, China's sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953, when males accounted for 51.82 percent of the total population. [490]\nEthnic groups\nMain articles: List of ethnic groups in China , Ethnic minorities in China , and Ethnic groups in Chinese history\nEthnolinguistic map of China in 1967\nChina legally recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, who altogether comprise the Zhonghua Minzu . The largest of these nationalities are the ethnic Chinese or \"Han\", who constitute more than 90% of the total population. [492] The Han Chinese – the world's largest single ethnic group [493] – outnumber other ethnic groups in every provincial-level division except Tibet and Xinjiang . [494] Ethnic minorities account for less than 10% of the population of China, according to the 2010 census. [492] Compared with the 2000 population census, the Han population increased by 66,537,177 persons, or 5.74%, while the population of the 55 national minorities combined increased by 7,362,627 persons, or 6.92%. [492] The 2010 census recorded a total of 593,832 foreign nationals living in China. The largest such groups were from South Korea (120,750), the United States (71,493) and Japan (66,159). [495]\nLanguages\nMain articles: Languages of China and List of endangered languages in China\nA trilingual sign in Xishuangbanna , with Tai Lü language on the top\nThere are as many as 292 living languages in China. [496] The languages most commonly spoken belong to the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family, which contains Mandarin (spoken by 70% of the population), [497] and other varieties of Chinese language : Yue (including Cantonese and Taishanese ), Wu (including Shanghainese and Suzhounese ), Min (including Fuzhounese , Hokkien and Teochew ), Xiang , Gan and Hakka . Languages of the Tibeto-Burman branch , including Tibetan , Qiang , Naxi and Yi , are spoken across the Tibetan and Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau . Other ethnic minority languages in southwest China include Zhuang , Thai , Dong and Sui of the Tai-Kadai family , Miao and Yao of the Hmong–Mien family , and Wa of the Austroasiatic family . Across northeastern and northwestern China , local ethnic groups speak Altaic languages including Manchu , Mongolian and several Turkic languages : Uyghur , Kazakh , Kyrgyz , Salar and Western Yugur . Korean is spoken natively along the border with North Korea . Sarikoli , the language of Tajiks in western Xinjiang , is an Indo-European language . Taiwanese aborigines , including a small population on the mainland, speak Austronesian languages . [498]\nLihaozhai High School in Jianshui , Yunnan . The sign is in Hani (Latin alphabet), Nisu ( Yi script ), and Chinese.\nStandard Mandarin , a variety of Mandarin based on the Beijing dialect , is the official national language of China and is used as a lingua franca in the country between people of different linguistic backgrounds. [499] [500] Mongolian, Uyghur, Tibetan, Zhuang and various other languages are also regionally recognized throughout the country. [501]\nUrbanization\nSee also: List of cities in China , List of cities in China by population , and Megalopolises in China\nMap of the ten largest cities in China (2010)\nChina has urbanized significantly in recent decades. The percent of the country's population living in urban areas increased from 20% in 1980 to over 60% in 2019. [502] [503] [504] It is estimated that China's urban population will reach one billion by 2030, potentially equivalent to one-eighth of the world population. [503] [504]\nChina has over 160 cities with a population of over one million, [505] including the 17 megacities as of 2021 [506] [507] (cities with a population of over 10 million) of Chongqing , Shanghai , Beijing , Chengdu , Guangzhou , Shenzhen , Tianjin , Xi'an , Suzhou , Zhengzhou , Wuhan , Hangzhou , Linyi , Shijiazhuang , Dongguan , Qingdao and Changsha . [508] Among them, the total permanent population of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu is above 20 million. [509] Shanghai is China's most populous urban area [510] [511] while Chongqing is its largest city proper , the only city in China with the largest permanent population of over 30 million. [512] By 2025, it is estimated that the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants. [503] The figures in the table below are from the 2017 census, [513] and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large \" floating populations \" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult; [514] the figures below include only long-term residents.

[520] In 2021, about 91.4 percent of students continued their education at a three-year senior secondary school. [521] The Gaokao , China's national university entrance exam, is a prerequisite for entrance into most higher education institutions. In 2010, 24 percent of secondary school graduates were enrolled in higher education. [522] This number increased significantly over the last decades, reaching a tertiary school enrolment of 58.42 percent in 2020. [523] Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and tertiary level. [524] More than 10 million Chinese students graduated from vocational colleges nationwide every year. [525]\nChina has the largest education system in the world, with about 282 million students and 17.32 million full-time teachers in over 530,000 schools. [526] In February 2006, the government pledged to provide completely free nine-year education, including textbooks and fees. [527] Annual education investment went from less than US$50 billion in 2003 to more than US$817 billion in 2020. [528] [529] However, there remains an inequality in education spending. In 2010, the annual education expenditure per secondary school student in Beijing totalled ¥20,023, while in Guizhou , one of the poorest provinces in China , only totalled ¥3,204. [530] Free compulsory education in China consists of primary school and junior secondary school between the ages of 6 and 15. In 2020, the graduation enrollment ratio at compulsory education level reached 95.2 percent, exceeding average levels recorded in high-income countries, [526] and around 91.2% of Chinese have received secondary education. [524]\nChina's literacy rate has grown dramatically, from only 20% in 1949 and 65.5% in 1979. [531] to 97% of the population over age 15 in 2018. [532] In the same year, China (Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu , and Zhejiang ) was ranked the highest in the world in the Programme for International Student Assessment ranking for all three categories of Mathematics, Science and Reading. [533]\nAs of 2021, China has over 3,000 universities, with over 44.3 million students enrolled in mainland China and 240 million Chinese citizens have received high education, making China the largest higher education system in the world. [534] [535] [536] As of 2021, China had the world's second-highest number of top universities (the highest in Asia & Oceania region). [537] Currently, China trails only the United States in terms of representation on lists of top 200 universities according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU). [538] China is home to the two of the highest ranking universities ( Tsinghua University and Peking University ) in Asia and emerging economies according to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings . [539] As of 2022, two universities in Mainland China rank in the world's top 15, with Peking University (12th) and Tsinghua University (14th) and three other universities ranking in the world's top 50, namely Fudan , Zhejiang , and Shanghai Jiao Tong according to the QS World University Rankings . [540] These universities are members of the C9 League , an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education.

[542] An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s. At that time, the Communist Party started the Patriotic Health Campaign , which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases. Diseases such as cholera , typhoid and scarlet fever , which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign. [ citation needed ]\nAfter Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition, although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the People's Communes. Healthcare in China became mostly privatized, and experienced a significant rise in quality. In 2009, the government began a 3-year large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion. [543] By 2011, the campaign resulted in 95% of China's population having basic health insurance coverage. [544] In 2011, China was estimated to be the world's third-largest supplier of pharmaceuticals , but its population has suffered from the development and distribution of counterfeit medications . [545]\nAs of 2017 [update] , the average life expectancy at birth in China is 76 years, [546] and the infant mortality rate is 7 per thousand. [547] Both have improved significantly since the 1950s. [ab] Rates of stunting , a condition caused by malnutrition , have declined from 33.1% in 1990 to 9.9% in 2010. [550] Despite significant improvements in health and the construction of advanced medical facilities, China has several emerging public health problems, such as respiratory illnesses caused by widespread air pollution , [551] hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers , [552] and an increase in obesity among urban youths. [553] [554] China's large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease outbreaks in recent years, such as the 2003 outbreak of SARS , although this has since been largely contained. [555] In 2010, air pollution caused 1.2 million premature deaths in China. [556]\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019. [557] [558] Further studies are being carried out around the world on a possible origin for the virus. [559] [560] Beijing says it has been sharing Covid data in \"a timely, open and transparent manner in accordance with the law\". [561] According to U.S. officials, the Chinese government has been concealing the extent of the outbreak before it became an international pandemic.

[569]\nFreedom of religion is guaranteed by China's constitution, although religious organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state persecution. [288] [570]\nOver the millennia, Chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements. The \" three teachings \", including Confucianism , Taoism , and Buddhism ( Chinese Buddhism ), historically have a significant role in shaping Chinese culture, [571] [572] enriching a theological and spiritual framework which harks back to the early Shang and Zhou dynasty . Chinese popular or folk religion, which is framed by the three teachings and other traditions, [573] consists in allegiance to the shen ( 神 ), a character that signifies the \" energies of generation \", who can be deities of the environment or ancestral principles of human groups, concepts of civility, culture heroes , many of whom feature in Chinese mythology and history. [574] Among the most popular cults are those of Mazu (goddess of the seas), [575]\nHuangdi (one of the two divine patriarchs of the Chinese race), [575] [576]\nGuandi (god of war and business), Caishen (god of prosperity and richness), Pangu and many others. China is home to many of the world's tallest religious statues , including the tallest of all, the Spring Temple Buddha in Henan . [577]\nClear data on religious affiliation in China is difficult to gather due to varying definitions of \"religion\" and the unorganized, diffusive nature of Chinese religious traditions. Scholars note that in China there is no clear boundary between three teachings religions and local folk religious practice. [571] A 2015 poll conducted by Gallup International found that 61% of Chinese people self-identified as \"convinced atheist\", [578] though it is worthwhile to note that Chinese religions or some of their strands are definable as non-theistic and humanistic religions, since they do not believe that divine creativity is completely transcendent, but it is inherent in the world and in particular in the human being. [579] According to a 2014 study, approximately 74% are either non-religious or practice Chinese folk belief, 16% are Buddhists, 2% are Christians, 1% are Muslims, and 8% adhere to other religions including Taoists and folk salvationism . [580] In addition to Han people's local religious practices, there are also various ethnic minority groups in China who maintain their traditional autochthone religions . The various folk religions today comprise 2–3% of the population, while Confucianism as a religious self-identification is common within the intellectual class. Significant faiths specifically connected to certain ethnic groups include Tibetan Buddhism and the Islamic religion of the Hui , Uyghur , Kazakh , Kyrgyz and other peoples in Northwest China. [ citation needed ] The 2010 population census reported the total number of Muslims in the country as 23.14 million.\nA 2021 poll from Ipsos and the Policy Institute at King's College London found that 35% of Chinese people said there was tension between different religious groups, which was the second lowest percentage of the 28 countries surveyed. [581] [582]\nCulture and society\nMain articles: Chinese culture and Culture of the People's Republic of China\nThe Temple of Heaven , a center of heaven worship and an UNESCO World Heritage site , symbolizes the Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind. [583]\nA Moon gate in a Chinese garden\nSince ancient times , Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism . For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious imperial examinations , which have their origins in the Han dynasty. [584] The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that calligraphy , poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective. [585] Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today. [586]\nFenghuang County , an ancient town that harbors many architectural remains of Ming and Qing styles [587]\nThe first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order but were influenced by the May Fourth Movement and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, sexism , and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as \"regressive and harmful\" or \"vestiges of feudalism \". Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as Confucianism, art, literature, and performing arts like Peking opera , [588] were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time. Access to foreign media remains heavily restricted. [589]\nToday, the Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese culture as being integral to Chinese society. With the rise of Chinese nationalism and the end of the Cultural Revolution, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival, [590] [591] and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide. [592]\nArchitecture\nMain articles: Chinese architecture and List of World Heritage Sites in China\nSiheyuan (四合院), literally meaning quadrangle in Chinese,has a history of over 2,000 years. [593]\nMany architectural masters and masterpieces emerged in ancient China , creating many palaces, tombs, temples, gardens, houses, etc.The architecture of China is as old as Chinese civilization. [594] The first communities that can be identified culturally as Chinese were settled chiefly in the basin of the Yellow River (黃河流域). [595]\nChinese architecture is the embodiment of an architectural style that has developed over millennia in China and has remained a vestigial source of perennial influence on the development of East Asian architecture. [596] [597] [598] [599] Since its emergence during the early ancient era, the structural principles of its architecture have remained largely unchanged. The main changes involved diverse decorative details. Starting with the Tang dynasty , [600] Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of neighboring East Asian countries such as Japan , Korea , and Mongolia . [601] and minor influences on the architecture of Southeast and South Asia including the countries of Malaysia , Singapore , Indonesia , Sri Lanka , Thailand , Laos , Cambodia , Vietnam and the Philippines . [602] [603] [604] Unfortunately, few ancient Chinese buildings survive today, but reconstructions can be made based on clay models, descriptions in contemporary texts, and depictions in art such as wall paintings and engraved bronze vessels. [601]\nThe Humble Administrator's Garden (拙政園) is a Chinese garden in Suzhou , a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most famous of the gardens of Suzhou. [605]\nChinese architecture is characterized by bilateral symmetry, use of enclosed open spaces, feng shui (e.g. directional hierarchies ), [606] a horizontal emphasis, and an allusion to various cosmological, mythological or in general symbolic elements. Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type, ranging from pagodas to palaces . [594] [601]\nChinese architecture varies widely based on status or affiliation, such as whether the structures were constructed for emperors, commoners, or for religious purposes. Other variations in Chinese architecture are shown in vernacular styles associated with different geographic regions and different ethnic heritages,such as the Stilt houses in the south, the Yaodong buildings in the northwest, the yurt buildings of nomadic people, and the Siheyuan buildings in the north. [607]\nSince the end of the Qing Dynasty , Western-style architecture has gradually become the mainstream architectural form in China, while Chinese-style architecture has gradually declined in the form of appearance. [594]\nTourism\nMain articles: Tourism in China and List of World Heritage Sites in China\nChina received 55.7 million inbound international visitors in 2010, [608] and in 2012 was the third-most-visited country in the world. [609] It also experiences an enormous volume of domestic tourism ; an estimated 740 million Chinese holidaymakers traveled within the country in October 2012. [610] China hosts the world's second-largest number of World Heritage Sites ( 56 ) after Italy, and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world ( first in the Asia-Pacific ).The number of domestic trips reached six billion in 2019. [611]\nLiterature\nMain article: Chinese literature\nThe stories in Journey to the West are common themes in Peking opera .\nChinese literature is based on the literature of the Zhou dynasty . [612] Concepts covered within the Chinese classic texts present a wide range of thoughts and subjects including calendar , military , astrology , herbology , geography and many others. [613] Some of the most important early texts include the I Ching and the Shujing within the Four Books and Five Classics which served as the Confucian authoritative books for the state-sponsored curriculum in dynastic era. Inherited from the Classic of Poetry , classical Chinese poetry developed to its floruit during the Tang dynasty. Li Bai and Du Fu opened the forking ways for the poetic circles through romanticism and realism respectively. Chinese historiography began with the Shiji , the overall scope of the historiographical tradition in China is termed the Twenty-Four Histories , which set a vast stage for Chinese fictions along with Chinese mythology and folklore . [614] Pushed by a burgeoning citizen class in the Ming dynasty, Chinese classical fiction rose to a boom of the historical, town and gods and demons fictions as represented by the Four Great Classical Novels which include Water Margin , Romance of the Three Kingdoms , Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber . [615] Along with the wuxia fictions of Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng , [616] it remains an enduring source of popular culture in the Chinese sphere of influence . [617]\nIn the wake of the New Culture Movement after the end of the Qing dynasty, Chinese literature embarked on a new era with written vernacular Chinese for ordinary citizens. Hu Shih and Lu Xun were pioneers in modern literature. [618] Various literary genres, such as misty poetry , scar literature , young adult fiction and the xungen literature , which is influenced by magic realism , [619] emerged following the Cultural Revolution. Mo Yan , a xungen literature author, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012. [620]\nCuisine\nMain article: Chinese cuisine\nMap showing major regional cuisines of China\nChinese cuisine is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history and geographical variety, in which the most influential are known as the \"Eight Major Cuisines\", including Sichuan , Cantonese , Jiangsu , Shandong , Fujian , Hunan , Anhui , and Zhejiang cuisines. [621] Chinese cuisine is also known for its width of cooking methods and ingredients, [622] as well as food therapy that is emphasized by traditional Chinese medicine . [623] [ better source needed ] Generally, China's staple food is rice in the south, wheat-based breads and noodles in the north. The diet of the common people in pre-modern times was largely grain and simple vegetables, with meat reserved for special occasions. The bean products, such as tofu and soy milk , remain as a popular source of protein. Pork is now the most popular meat in China, accounting for about three-fourths of the country's total meat consumption. [624] While pork dominates the meat market, there is also the vegetarian Buddhist cuisine and the pork-free Chinese Islamic cuisine . Southern cuisine, due to the area's proximity to the ocean and milder climate, has a wide variety of seafood and vegetables; it differs in many respects from the wheat-based diets across dry northern China. Numerous offshoots of Chinese food, such as Hong Kong cuisine and American Chinese food , have emerged in the nations that play host to the Chinese diaspora . [ citation needed ]\nMusic\nMain articles: Music of China , C-pop , and Chinese opera\nChinese music covers a highly diverse range of music from traditional music to modern music. Chinese music dates back before the pre-imperial times. Traditional Chinese musical instruments were traditionally grouped into eight categories known as bayin (八音). Traditional Chinese opera is a form of musical theatre in China originating thousands of years and has regional style forms such as Beijing opera and Cantonese opera . [625] Chinese pop (C-Pop) includes mandopop and cantopop . Chinese rap , Chinese hip hop and Hong Kong hip hop have become popular in contemporary times. [626]\nCinema\nMain article: Cinema of China\nCinema was first introduced to China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, Dingjun Mountain , was released in 1905. [627] China has the largest number of movie screens in the world since 2016, [628] China became the largest cinema market in the world in 2020. [629] [630] The top 3 highest-grossing films in China currently are Wolf Warrior 2 (2017) , Ne Zha (2019), and The Wandering Earth (2019). [631]\nFashion\nMain articles: Fashion in China and Hanfu\nHanfu is the historical clothing of the Han people in China. The qipao or cheongsam is a popular Chinese female dress. [632] The hanfu movement has been popular in contemporary times and seeks to revitalize Hanfu clothing. [633]\nSports\nMain articles: Sport in China , China at the Olympics , and China at the Paralympics\nChina has one of the oldest sporting cultures in the world. There is evidence that archery ( shèjiàn ) was practiced during the Western Zhou dynasty . Swordplay ( jiànshù ) and cuju , a sport loosely related to association football [634] date back to China's early dynasties as well. [635]\nGo is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent and was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago.\nPhysical fitness is widely emphasized in Chinese culture, with morning exercises such as qigong and t'ai chi ch'uan widely practiced, [636] and commercial gyms and private fitness clubs are gaining popularity across the country. [637] Basketball is currently the most popular spectator sport in China. [638] The Chinese Basketball Association and the American National Basketball Association have a huge following among the people, with native or ethnic Chinese players such as Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian held in high esteem. [639] China's professional football league, now known as Chinese Super League , was established in 1994, it is the largest football market in East Asia. [640] Other popular sports in the country include martial arts , table tennis , badminton , swimming and snooker . Board games such as go (known as wéiqí in Chinese), xiangqi , mahjong , and more recently chess , are also played at a professional level. [641] In addition, China is home to a huge number of cyclists , with an estimated 470 million bicycles as of 2012 [update] . [458] Many more traditional sports, such as dragon boat racing, Mongolian-style wrestling and horse racing are also popular. [642]\nChina has participated in the Olympic Games since 1932, although it has only participated as the PRC since 1952 . China hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where its athletes received 48 gold medals – the highest number of gold medals of any participating nation that year. [643] China also won the most medals of any nation at the 2012 Summer Paralympics , with 231 overall, including 95 gold medals. [644] [645] In 2011, Shenzhen in Guangdong, China hosted the 2011 Summer Universiade . China hosted the 2013 East Asian Games in Tianjin and the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing ; the first country to host both regular and Youth Olympics. Beijing and its nearby city Zhangjiakou of Hebei province collaboratively hosted the 2022 Olympic Winter Games , making Beijing the first dual olympic city in the world by holding both the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.

The total area of China is listed as 9,572,900 km 2 (3,696,100 sq mi) by the Encyclopædia Britannica .

See List of countries and dependencies by area for more information. The following two primary sources (non-mirrored) represent the range (min./max.) of estimates of China's and the United States' total areas. Both sources (1) exclude Taiwan from the area of China; (2) exclude China's coastal and territorial waters. However, the CIA World Factbook includes the United States coastal and territorial waters, while Encyclopædia Britannica excludes the United States coastal and territorial waters.\nThe Encyclopædia Britannica lists China as world's third-largest country (after Russia and Canada ) with a total area of 9,572,900 km 2 , [13] and the United States as fourth-largest at 9,525,067 km 2 . [14]\nThe CIA World Factbook lists China as the fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada and the United States) with a total area of 9,596,960 km 2 , [15] and the United States as the third-largest at 9,833,517 km 2 . [16]\nNotably, the Encyclopædia Britannica specifies the United States' area (excluding coastal and territorial waters) as 9,525,067 km 2 , which is less than either source's figure given for China's area. [14] Therefore, while it can be determined that China has a larger area excluding coastal and territorial waters, it is unclear which country has a larger area including coastal and territorial waters.\nThe United Nations Statistics Division 's figure for the United States is 9,833,517 km 2 (3,796,742 sq mi) and China is 9,596,961 km 2 (3,705,407 sq mi). These closely match the CIA World Factbook figures and similarly include coastal and territorial waters for the United States, but exclude coastal and territorial waters for China.\nFurther explanation of disputed ranking: The dispute about which is the world's third-largest country arose from the inclusion of coastal and territorial waters for the United States. This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA World Factbook and its previous iterations [17] against the information for United States in Encyclopædia Britannica , particularly its footnote section. [14] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA World Factbook (from 1982 to 1996), the U.S. was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610 km 2 (3,618,780 sq mi). However, in the 1997 edition, the U.S. added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091 km 2 (3,717,813 sq mi)). And then again in 2007, U.S. added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517 km 2 (3,796,742 sq mi)). During this time, China's total area remained unchanged. In other words, no coastal or territorial water area was added to China's total area figure. The United States has a coastal water area of 109,362 km 2 (42,225 sq mi), and a territorial water area of 195,213 km 2 (75,372 sq mi), for a total of 304,575 km 2 (117,597 sq mi) of additional water space. This is larger than entire countries like Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Adding this figure to the U.S. will boost it over China in ranking since China's coastal and territorial water figures are currently unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure.\n^ a\nb\nChina claims the de facto state of Taiwan , which it does not control, as its disputed 23rd province, i.e. Taiwan Province .

[22]\n^\nAlthough this is the present meaning of guó , in Old Chinese (when its pronunciation was something like /*qʷˤək/ ) [28] it meant the walled city of the Chinese and the areas they could control from them. [29]\n^\nIts earliest extant use is on the ritual bronze vessel He zun , where it apparently refers to only the Shang 's immediate demesne conquered by the Zhou . [30]\n^\nIts meaning \"Zhou's royal demesne\" is attested from the 6th-century BC Classic of History , which states \" Huangtian bestowed the lands and the peoples of the central state to the ancestors\" ( 皇天既付中國民越厥疆土于先王 ). [31]\n^\nOwing to Qin Shi Huang's earlier policy involving the \" burning of books and burying of scholars \", the destruction of the confiscated copies at Xianyang was an event similar to the destructions of the Library of Alexandria in the west. Even those texts that did survive had to be painstakingly reconstructed from memory, luck, or forgery. [59] The Old Texts of the Five Classics were said to have been found hidden in a wall at the Kong residence in Qufu . Mei Ze 's \"rediscovered\" edition of the Book of Documents was only shown to be a forgery in the Qing dynasty .\n^\nChina is larger than Canada and the United States in terms of land area.\n^\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica , the total area of the United States, at 9,522,055 km 2 (3,676,486 sq mi), is slightly smaller than that of China. Meanwhile, the CIA World Factbook states that China's total area was greater than that of the United States until the coastal waters of the Great Lakes was added to the United States' total area in 1996. From 1989 through 1996, the total area of US was listed as 9,372,610 km 2 (3,618,780 sq mi) (land area plus inland water only). The listed total area changed to 9,629,091 km 2 (3,717,813 sq mi) in 1997 (with the Great Lakes areas and the coastal waters added), to 9,631,418 km 2 (3,718,711 sq mi) in 2004, to 9,631,420 km 2 (3,718,710 sq mi) in 2006, and to 9,826,630 km 2 (3,794,080 sq mi) in 2007 (territorial waters added).\n^\nChina's border with Pakistan and part of its border with India falls in the disputed region of Kashmir .

Early 20th-century mountaineers and climbers were focused on reaching the tops of iconic mountains (e.g. the eight-thousanders ) and climbing routes (e.g. the great north faces of the Alps ) by whatever means possible, often using considerable amounts of aid climbing , or with large expedition style support teams that laid \"siege\" to the climb.\nAs all the key tops were summited, the manner in which the top was reached became important, particularly the ability to complete the ascent without artificial aid, which is called free climbing . In free climbing, the term first free ascent (abbreviated FFA ) is used where a mountain or climbing route was ascended without any artificial aid (devices for protection in the event of a fall could be used as long as they did not aid progression). Completing the FFA of a climbing route is often called freeing (or more latterly sending ) a route.\nRelated terms [ edit ]\nMountaineering [ edit ]\nAs mountaineering developed in the 20th century, the attainment of a summit by almost any means was replaced by ascents that reflected the style used and the conditions faced. In 2008, the most prestigious annual prize in mountaineering, the Piolet d'Or , amended its focus to small light-weight alpine-style teams using no form of aid or support, rather than on large expedition-style teams using \"siege\" techniques. [1]\nThe most notable types of mountaineering first ascents that are chronicled are:\nFirst ascent. The most notable first ascents started with the golden age of alpinism when the main alpine peaks were summited (and often using aid climbing ). In the 1930s, the focus moved to the first ascents of the great north faces of the Alps , and the Eiger in particular. The 1950s saw the first ascents of most of the fourteen eight-thousanders , and Everest in particular. By the 1980s, the rock spires of Trango Towers in the Karakorum , and Torres del Paine in Patagonia also had first ascents.\nFirst winter ascent. The winter climbing season is between December 21 and March 20. [2] The first winter ascents of the great north faces of the Alps were a coveted prize, particularly the \"Trilogy\" of the three hardest, the Eiger, the Matterhorn , and the Grandes Jorasses . The most notable first winter ascents were the Himalayan eight-thousanders , [2] where the hardest, K2 , was only summited in winter in 2021 (66 years after its first ascent) and considered a \"holy grail\" of mountaineering prizes. [3]\nFirst alpine-style (or unsupported) ascent. In 2008, the charter of the prestigious Piolet d'Or prize was amended to focus on small teams with no support making fast, but riskier, ascents on routes that had previously been done by expeditions. [4] [5] Multiple Piolet d'Or winners, whose ascents embodied this style, included Marko Prezelj , Mick Fowler , and Ueli Steck . [4] The charter was amended to de-incentivize excessive risk-taking after the notable deaths of several prize winners, including David Lama , and Hansjörg Auer . [1] [6]\nFirst solo ascent. The most dangerous form of alpine-style ascent is the solo climbing ascent, performed by a single climber. The first solo ascents of the alpine north faces, including the first solo winter ascents, were coveted (the winter solo \"Trilogy\" was completed by Ivano Ghirardini in 1977–78); one of the most famous practitioners was the Italian Walter Bonatti . [7] Himalayan solo ascents are also coveted, although problems around verification are more frequent due to the more remote nature of the routes, with notable disputes such as Tomo Česen 's first solo ascent of the south face of Lhotse . [7] [4] [6]\nRock climbing [ edit ]\nAdam Ondra making the first redpoint ascent of Silence , the world's first 9c  (5.15d) sport climb.\nIn rock climbing, the manner in which the first free ascent was achieved became important to chronicle by climbing journals and magazines. The key differentiators were the style on which the route was free climbed (e.g. traditional climbing , sport climbing , or free solo climbing ), whether the free climb was done on the first attempt (e.g. onsighted ), and whether the climber had prior information, or beta . [8] [9] [10]\nThe most notable types of rock climbing first ascents that are chronicled are:\nFirst free ascent (traditional climbing only). Pre-1980s, the FFAs were by traditional climbing techniques. A distinction was recorded if a climber practiced the moves on a top rope , called \" headpointing \", although with the post-1980s dominance of \" redpointing \" as the definition of an FFA, such a distinction was dropped. [a] [9] [10] FFAs that set new grade milestones are notable, for both male and female climbers. [12]\nFirst greenpoint ascent (traditional climbing only). In the 2010s, traditional climbers used greenpointing (as a counterpoint to a \"redpoint\"), to describe climbing a pre-bolted sport climbing route, but only using \"traditional protection\" (i.e. protection that is not permanently fixed via pre-placed bolts or pitons). [13] [14]\nSonnie Trotter 's greenpoint of The Path (5.14a R, 2007), is a notable example. [15] [16]\nFirst redpoint ascent (sport climbing only). In the 1980s, climbers wanted to ascend routes that had no opportunities for traditional climbing protection, and they had to be pre-bolted with protection (but not aid), which was called sport climbing. The greatest progression in grade milestones was now in sport climbing. The \" redpoint \" became the accepted definition for what determined a \"first free ascent\" in sport climbing. [9] [10]\nHeinz Zak  [ de ] makes the first repeat free solo ascent of Separate Reality in Yosemite\nFirst repeat ascent (traditional or sport climbing). The grading of a route can be complicated as the person making the FFA had no prior information or beta . The first repeat is therefore chronicled for confirmation of a grade, particularly when a new grade milestone is proposed. For the highest grades, the first repeat can take years (e.g. Action Directe or Jumbo Love ), or even decades (e.g. Open Air  [ de ] ).\nFirst onsight ascent (traditional or sport climbing). An FFA that was onsighted , means it was done at the very first attempt, and without prior information (or beta). [9] [10] Climbing journals chronicle the progression of grade milestones of onsights both male and female climbers. [12]\nFirst flash ascent (traditional or sport climbing). An FFA that was flashed , means it was done at the first attempt, but with prior information (or beta). [9] [10] Climbing journals chronicle the progression of grade milestones for flashed routes by male and female climbers. [12] With the availability of route beta online (e.g. videos of prior ascents), the distinction between onsight and flash ascents has diminished. [17]\nFirst free solo ascent (independent of traditional or sport climbing). Free soloing is practiced by a smaller community of climbers and is a controversial area given the risks undertaken and whether such risks should be recorded and thus implicitly endorsed. [18] Free solo climbing grade milestones are chronicled, [12] the most notable being Free Solo , the Oscar-winning film of Alex Honnold 's first free solo ascent of Freerider in Yosemite . [18]\nGender [ edit ]\nJosune Bereziartu on the FFA and FFFA of Yeah Man (8b+ 5.14a, 300-metres, 9 pitches), on the Grand Pfad in Bern, Switzerland\nFirst female free ascent (abbreviated FFFA ). [19] Important female climbers emerged in the 1980s including Lynn Hill and Catherine Destivelle , and climbing journals began to chronicle milestones in female first free ascents . [12] In some cases, an FFFA is also an FFA, and arguably the most famous example being Lynn Hill's 1993 FFA/FFFA of the 3,000-foot Nose on El Capitan ( 5.14a/b ), considered the biggest prize in big wall climbing , announced by Hill to the world's climbing media by: \"It goes, boys\". [20] By the 2000s, Josune Bereziartu , Angela Eiter and Ashima Shiraishi , closed the gap to the highest sport climbing grades achieved by men to within one/two notches, [21] [22] while Beth Rodden had fully closed the gap for traditional climbing. [22]\nNotable disputes [ edit ]\nThere have been notable disputes over claims of a first ascent (or first free ascent), for various reasons (disputes over the style employed, issues with verifiability, accusations of bad faith and fraud), and the most notable are where a new grade milestone and/or major advancement in difficulty is being proposed: [8]\nMountaineering [ edit ]\nFirst ascent of Everest: Arguably the most famous case of an unverified first ascent is whether George Mallory and/or Andrew Irvine reached the summit of Everest on the 1924 Everest expedition . Subsequent Everest expeditions have not been able to answer the question including the 1999 Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition , and the 2007 Altitude Everest expedition .\nFirst ascent of Cerro Torre : In 1959, Cesare Maestri claimed he and Toni Egger  [ it ] summited, but that Egger who had the camera, was swept to his death by an avalanche on the descent. Lionel Terry called it \"the greatest climbing feat of all time\". [23] Inconsistencies in Maestri's account, and the lack of equipment on the route, led most to doubt his claim. [23] Maestri further inflamed the controversy by returning in 1970 and drilling 400 bolts onto his new Compressor Route , to claim the second ascent. [23] In 2012, yet more controversy followed when American climbers Hayden Kenndey and Jason Kruk, removed Maestri's bolts, enabling David Lama and Peter Ortner to make the FFA, for which all four won a 2013 Piolet d'Or . [23]\nRock climbing [ edit ]\nIn 1995, French climber Fred Rouhling created a major controversy when he proposed Akira  [ fr ] as the world's first-ever 9b  (5.15b) route, when the highest grade at the time, Action Directe , was only at 9a  (5.14d). [24] Rouhling faced an unprecedented level of personal vilification from parts of the climbing community on whether he had actually climbed the route, as all other attempts had failed. [24] In 2020, Sébastien Bouin made the first repeat of Akira and estimated its grade at 9a  (5.14d), a grade Rouhling has climbed on other routes, and thus his FFA became accepted. [25] [26]\nIn 2003, Spanish climber Bernabé Fernández proposed Chilam Balam  [ fr ] as the world's first-ever 9b+  (5.15c) route, when the highest grade at the time, Realization , was at 9a+  (5.15a). As with Fred Rouhling on Akira , his claim provoked a significant backlash from parts of the climbing community, and accusations that he did not actually complete an FFA (the person who belayed him could not be identified to help verification). [27] The route was repeated in 2011 by Adam Ondra who downgraded it, [27] and further repeats reduced its grade to circa 9a+  (5.15a). [28] [29]\nSee also [ edit ]\nList of first ascents in the Alps\nFirst ascent of the Matterhorn\nList of first ascents of mountain summits\nList of first ascents of eight-thousander mountains\nList of grade milestones in rock climbing\nNotes [ edit ]\n^\nWhile headpointing was once considered a lesser form of first free ascent in traditional climbing (and an FFA that had been headpointed would be asterisked as such), leading traditional climbers eventually followed the redpointing practices of sport climbers (i.e. practicing the route over-and-over in a safe way), and dispensed with the stigma associated with headpointing.

[1] It is the simplest, oldest and most widely used of the various spatial reference systems that are in use, and forms the basis for most others. Although latitude and longitude form a coordinate tuple like a cartesian coordinate system , the geographic coordinate system is not cartesian because the measurements are angles and are not on a planar surface. [2] [ self-published source? ]\nA full GCS specification, such as those listed in the EPSG and ISO 19111 standards, also includes a choice of geodetic datum (including an Earth ellipsoid ), as different datums will yield different latitude and longitude values for the same location. [3]\nHistory [ edit ]\nFurther information: History of geodesy , history of longitude , and history of prime meridians\nThe invention of a geographic coordinate system is generally credited to Eratosthenes of Cyrene , who composed his now-lost Geography at the Library of Alexandria in the 3rd century BC. [4] A century later, Hipparchus of Nicaea improved on this system by determining latitude from stellar measurements rather than solar altitude and determining longitude by timings of lunar eclipses , rather than dead reckoning . In the 1st or 2nd century, Marinus of Tyre compiled an extensive gazetteer and mathematically plotted world map using coordinates measured east from a prime meridian at the westernmost known land, designated the Fortunate Isles , off the coast of western Africa around the Canary or Cape Verde Islands , and measured north or south of the island of Rhodes off Asia Minor . Ptolemy credited him with the full adoption of longitude and latitude, rather than measuring latitude in terms of the length of the midsummer day. [5]\nPtolemy's 2nd-century Geography used the same prime meridian but measured latitude from the Equator instead. After their work was translated into Arabic in the 9th century, Al-Khwārizmī 's Book of the Description of the Earth corrected Marinus' and Ptolemy's errors regarding the length of the Mediterranean Sea , [note 1] causing medieval Arabic cartography to use a prime meridian around 10° east of Ptolemy's line. Mathematical cartography resumed in Europe following Maximus Planudes ' recovery of Ptolemy's text a little before 1300; the text was translated into Latin at Florence by Jacobus Angelus around 1407.\nIn 1884, the United States hosted the International Meridian Conference , attended by representatives from twenty-five nations. Twenty-two of them agreed to adopt the longitude of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England as the zero-reference line. The Dominican Republic voted against the motion, while France and Brazil abstained. [6] France adopted Greenwich Mean Time in place of local determinations by the Paris Observatory in 1911.\nLatitude and longitude [ edit ]\nDiagram of the latitude ϕ and longitude λ angle measurements for a spherical model of the Earth.\nMain articles: Latitude and Longitude\nThe \"latitude\" (abbreviation: Lat., ϕ , or phi) of a point on Earth's surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and the straight line that passes through that point and through (or close to) the center of the Earth. [note 2] Lines joining points of the same latitude trace circles on the surface of Earth called parallels , as they are parallel to the Equator and to each other. The North Pole is 90° N; the South Pole is 90° S. The 0° parallel of latitude is designated the Equator , the fundamental plane of all geographic coordinate systems. The Equator divides the globe into Northern and Southern Hemispheres .\nThe \"longitude\" (abbreviation: Long., λ , or lambda) of a point on Earth's surface is the angle east or west of a reference meridian to another meridian that passes through that point. All meridians are halves of great ellipses (often called great circles ), which converge at the North and South Poles. The meridian of the British\nRoyal Observatory in Greenwich , in southeast London, England, is the international prime meridian , although some organizations—such as the French Institut national de l'information géographique et forestière —continue to use other meridians for internal purposes. The prime meridian determines the proper Eastern and Western Hemispheres , although maps often divide these hemispheres further west in order to keep the Old World on a single side. The antipodal meridian of Greenwich is both 180°W and 180°E. This is not to be conflated with the International Date Line , which diverges from it in several places for political and convenience reasons, including between far eastern Russia and the far western Aleutian Islands .\nThe combination of these two components specifies the position of any location on the surface of Earth, without consideration of altitude or depth. The visual grid on a map formed by lines of latitude and longitude is known as a graticule . [7] The origin/zero point of this system is located in the Gulf of Guinea about 625 km (390 mi) south of Tema , Ghana , a location often facetiously called Null Island .\nGeodetic datum [ edit ]\nMain article: Geodetic datum\nFurther information: Figure of the Earth , Reference ellipsoid , Geographic coordinate conversion , and Spatial reference system\nIn order to be unambiguous about the direction of \"vertical\" and the \"horizontal\" surface above which they are measuring, map-makers choose a reference ellipsoid with a given origin and orientation that best fits their need for the area to be mapped. They then choose the most appropriate mapping of the spherical coordinate system onto that ellipsoid, called a terrestrial reference system or geodetic datum .\nDatums may be global, meaning that they represent the whole Earth, or they may be local, meaning that they represent an ellipsoid best-fit to only a portion of the Earth. Points on the Earth's surface move relative to each other due to continental plate motion, subsidence, and diurnal Earth tidal movement caused by the Moon and the Sun. This daily movement can be as much as a meter. Continental movement can be up to 10 cm a year, or 10 m in a century. A weather system high-pressure area can cause a sinking of 5 mm . Scandinavia is rising by 1 cm a year as a result of the melting of the ice sheets of the last ice age , but neighboring Scotland is rising by only 0.2 cm . These changes are insignificant if a local datum is used, but are statistically significant if a global datum is used. [8]\nExamples of global datums include World Geodetic System (WGS   84, also known as EPSG:4326 [9] ), the default datum used for the Global Positioning System , [note 3] and the International Terrestrial Reference System and Frame (ITRF), used for estimating continental drift and crustal deformation . [10] The distance to Earth's center can be used both for very deep positions and for positions in space. [8]\nLocal datums chosen by a national cartographical organization include the North American Datum , the European ED50 , and the British OSGB36 . Given a location, the datum provides the latitude\nϕ\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\nand longitude\nλ\n{\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n. In the United Kingdom there are three common latitude, longitude, and height systems in use. WGS   84 differs at Greenwich from the one used on published maps OSGB36 by approximately 112   m. The military system ED50 , used by NATO , differs from about 120   m to 180   m. [8]\nThe latitude and longitude on a map made against a local datum may not be the same as one obtained from a GPS receiver. Converting coordinates from one datum to another requires a datum transformation such as a Helmert transformation , although in certain situations a simple translation may be sufficient. [11]\nIn popular GIS software, data projected in latitude/longitude is often represented as a Geographic Coordinate System . For example, data in latitude/longitude if the datum is the North American Datum of 1983 is denoted by 'GCS North American 1983'.\nLength of a degree [ edit ]\nMain articles: Length of a degree of latitude and Length of a degree of longitude\nSee also: Arc length § Great circles on Earth\nOn the GRS   80 or WGS   84 spheroid at sea level at the Equator, one latitudinal second measures 30.715 meters , one latitudinal minute is 1843 meters and one latitudinal degree is 110.6 kilometers. The circles of longitude, meridians, meet at the geographical poles, with the west–east width of a second naturally decreasing as latitude increases. On the Equator at sea level, one longitudinal second measures 30.92 meters, a longitudinal minute is 1855 meters and a longitudinal degree is 111.3 kilometers. At 30° a longitudinal second is 26.76 meters, at Greenwich (51°28′38″N) 19.22 meters, and at 60° it is 15.42 meters.\nOn the WGS   84 spheroid, the length in meters of a degree of latitude at latitude ϕ (that is, the number of meters you would have to travel along a north–south line to move 1 degree in latitude, when at latitude ϕ ), is about\n111132.92\n−\n559.82\ncos\n⁡\n2\nϕ\n+\n1.175\ncos\n⁡\n4\nϕ\n−\n0.0023\ncos\n⁡\n6\nϕ\n{\\displaystyle 111132.92-559.82\\,\\cos 2\\phi +1.175\\,\\cos 4\\phi -0.0023\\,\\cos 6\\phi }\n[12]\nThe returned measure of meters per degree latitude varies continuously with latitude.\nSimilarly, the length in meters of a degree of longitude can be calculated as\n111412.84\ncos\n⁡\nϕ\n−\n93.5\ncos\n⁡\n3\nϕ\n+\n0.118\ncos\n⁡\n5\nϕ\n{\\displaystyle 111412.84\\,\\cos \\phi -93.5\\,\\cos 3\\phi +0.118\\,\\cos 5\\phi }\n[12]\n(Those coefficients can be improved, but as they stand the distance they give is correct within a centimeter.)\nThe formulae both return units of meters per degree.\nAn alternative method to estimate the length of a longitudinal degree at latitude\nϕ\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\nis to assume a spherical Earth (to get the width per minute and second, divide by 60 and 3600, respectively):\nπ\n180\nM\nr\ncos\n⁡\nϕ\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\pi }{180}}M_{r}\\cos \\phi \\!}\nwhere Earth's average meridional radius\nM\nr\n{\\displaystyle \\textstyle {M_{r}}\\,\\!}\nis 6,367,449 m . Since the Earth is an oblate spheroid , not spherical, that result can be off by several tenths of a percent; a better approximation of a longitudinal degree at latitude\nϕ\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\nis\nπ\n180\na\ncos\n⁡\nβ\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\pi }{180}}a\\cos \\beta \\,\\!}\nwhere Earth's equatorial radius\na\n{\\displaystyle a}\nequals 6,378,137 m and\ntan\n⁡\nβ\n=\nb\na\ntan\n⁡\nϕ\n{\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\tan \\beta ={\\frac {b}{a}}\\tan \\phi }\\,\\!}\n; for the GRS   80 and WGS   84 spheroids, b/a calculates to be 0.99664719. (\nβ\n{\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\beta }\\,\\!}\nis known as the reduced (or parametric) latitude ). Aside from rounding, this is the exact distance along a parallel of latitude; getting the distance along the shortest route will be more work, but those two distances are always within 0.6 meter of each other if the two points are one degree of longitude apart.\nLongitudinal length equivalents at selected latitudes\nLatitude\nCity\nDegree\nMinute\nSecond\n±0.0001°\n60°\nSaint Petersburg\n55.80 km\n0.930 km\n15.50 m\n5.58 m\n51° 28′ 38″ N\nGreenwich\n69.47 km\n1.158 km\n19.30 m\n6.95 m\n45°\nBordeaux\n78.85 km\n1.31 km\n21.90 m\n7.89 m\n30°\nNew Orleans\n96.49 km\n1.61 km\n26.80 m\n9.65 m\n0°\nQuito\n111.3 km\n1.855 km\n30.92 m\n11.13 m\nAlternate encodings [ edit ]\nLike any series of multiple-digit numbers, latitude-longitude pairs can be challenging to communicate and remember. Therefore, alternative schemes have been developed for encoding GCS coordinates into alphanumeric strings or words:\nthe Maidenhead Locator System , popular with radio operators.\nthe World Geographic Reference System (GEOREF), developed for global military operations, replaced by the current Global Area Reference System (GARS).\nOpen Location Code or \"Plus Codes\", developed by Google and released into the public domain.\nGeohash , a public domain system based on the Morton Z-order curve .\nMapcode , an open-source system originally developed at TomTom.\nWhat3words , a proprietary system that encodes GCS coordinates as pseudorandom sets of words by dividing the coordinates into three numbers and looking up words in an indexed dictionary.\nNote that these are not distinct coordinate systems, only alternative methods for expressing latitude and longitude measurements.\nSee also [ edit ]\nDecimal degrees  – Angular measurements, typically for latitude and longitude\nGeographical distance  – Distance measured along the surface of the earth\nGeographic information system  – System to capture, manage and present geographic data\nGeo URI scheme  – URI scheme for geographic locations Pages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nISO 6709 , standard representation of geographic point location by coordinates\nLinear referencing  – method of spatial referencing Pages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nPrimary direction  – Primary directions in astrology\nPlanetary coordinate system\nSelenographic coordinate system\nSpatial reference system  – System to specify locations on Earth\nJan Smits (2015).

[13] It borders Azad Kashmir to the south, the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west, the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan to the north, the Xinjiang region of China , to the east and northeast, and the Indian-administered union territories Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to the southeast.\nThe region, together with Azad Kashmir in the southwest, is grouped and referred to by the United Nations and other international organisations as \" Pakistan-administered Kashmir \". [note 1] Gilgit-Baltistan is six times larger than Azad Kashmir in terms of geographical area. [18]\nThe territory of present-day Gilgit-Baltistan became a separate administrative unit in 1970 under the name \"Northern Areas\". It was formed by the amalgamation of the former Gilgit Agency , the Baltistan district , and several small former princely states , the largest of which were Hunza and Nagar . [19] In 2009, the region was renamed to \"Gilgit-Baltistan\" and granted limited autonomy through the Self-Governance Order signed in by former Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari , a move that was reportedly intended to also empower the territory's people; however, scholars state that the real power rests with the governor and not with the chief minister or elected assembly. [20] [21] Much of the population of Gilgit-Baltistan reportedly wants the territory to become integrated with Pakistan proper as a fifth province, and opposes integration with the rest of the Kashmir region. [22] [23] The Pakistani government had rejected calls from the territory for provincial status on the grounds that granting such a request would jeopardise Pakistan's demands for the entire Kashmir conflict to be resolved according to all related United Nations resolutions . [24] However, in November 2020, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan announced that Gilgit-Baltistan would attain provisional provincial status after the 2020 Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly election . [25] [26] [27]\nGilgit-Baltistan covers an area of over 72,971 km 2 (28,174 sq mi) [6] and is highly mountainous. It had an estimated population of 1.249 million people in 2013 [28] [29] (estimated to be 1.8 million in 2015 ( Shahid Javed Burki (2015) ). Its capital city is Gilgit with an estimated population of 216,760. It's economy is dominated by agriculture and the tourism industry . [30] The region is home to five of the 14 eight-thousanders , including K2 , and additionally has more than fifty mountain peaks above 7,000 metres (23,000 ft). Three of the world's longest glaciers outside of Earth's polar regions are found in Gilgit-Baltistan. The main tourism activities are trekking and mountaineering , and this industry has been growing in importance throughout the region.\nEarly history\nMain article: History of Gilgit-Baltistan\nPhotograph of Kargah Buddha in Gilgit ; \"The ancient Stupa – rock carvings of Buddha, everywhere in the region, point to the firm hold of Buddhism for such a long time.\" [31]\nThe rock carvings found in various places in Gilgit-Baltistan, especially in the Passu village of Hunza , suggest a human presence since 2000 BC. [32] Within the next few centuries of human settlement on the Tibetan plateau , this region became inhabited by Tibetans, who preceded the Balti people of Baltistan . Today Baltistan bears similarity to Ladakh physically and culturally (although not in religion). Dards are found mainly in the western areas. These people are the Shina -speaking peoples of Gilgit, Chilas , Astore and Diamir , while in Hunza and the upper regions, Burushaski and Khowar speakers predominate. The Dards find mention in the works of Herodotus , [note 2]\nNearchus , Megasthenes , Pliny , [note 3]\nPtolemy , [note 4] and the geographical lists of the Puranas . [33] In the 1st century, the people of these regions were followers of the Bon religion while in the 2nd century, they practiced Buddhism.\nBetween 399 and 414, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Faxian visited Gilgit-Baltistan. [34] In the 6th century Somana Palola (greater Gilgit-Chilas) was ruled by an unknown king. Between 627 and 645, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang travelled through this region on his pilgrimage to India.\nAccording to Chinese records from the Tang dynasty , between the 600s and the 700s, the region was governed by a Buddhist dynasty referred to as Bolü ( Chinese : 勃律 ; pinyin : bólǜ ), also transliterated as Palola , Patola , Balur . [35] They are believed to have been the Patola Shahis dynasty mentioned in a Brahmi inscription, [36] and devout adherents of Vajrayana Buddhism . [37] At the time, Little Palola ( Chinese : 小勃律 ) was used to refer to Gilgit, while Great Palola ( Chinese : 大勃律 ) was used to refer to Baltistan. However, the records do not consistently disambiguate the two.\nMap of Tibetan Empire citing the areas of Gilgit-Baltistan as part of its kingdom in 780–790 CE\nIn mid-600s, Gilgit came under Chinese suzerainty after the fall of the Western Turkic Khaganate to Tang military campaigns in the region . In the late 600s CE, the rising Tibetan Empire wrestled control of the region from the Chinese. However, faced with growing influence of the Umayyad Caliphate and then the Abbasid Caliphate to the west, the Tibetans were forced to ally themselves with the Islamic caliphates. The region was then contested by Chinese and Tibetan forces, and their respective vassal states, until the mid-700s. [38] Rulers of Gilgit formed an alliance with the Tang Chinese, and held back the Arabs with their help. [39]\nBetween 644 and 655, Navasurendrāditya-nandin became king of the Palola Sāhi dynasty in Gilgit. [40] Numerous Sanskrit inscriptions, including the Danyor Rock Inscriptions , were discovered to be from his reign. [41] In the late 600s and early 700s, Jayamaṅgalavikramāditya-nandin was king of Gilgit. [40]\nAccording to Chinese court records, in 717 and 719 respectively, delegations of a ruler of Great Palola (Baltistan) named Su-fu-she-li-ji-li-ni ( Chinese : 蘇弗舍利支離泥 ; pinyin : sūfúshèlìzhīlíní ) reached the Chinese imperial court. [42] [43] By at least 719/720, Ladakh (Mard) became part of the Tibetan Empire . By that time, Buddhism was practised in Baltistan , and Sanskrit was the written language.\nIn 720, the delegation of Surendrāditya ( Chinese : 蘇麟陀逸之 ; pinyin : sūlíntuóyìzhī ) reached the Chinese imperial court. He was referred to in Chinese records as the king of Great Palola; however, it is unknown if Baltistan was under Gilgit rule at the time. [44] The Chinese emperor also granted the ruler of Cashmere, Chandrāpīḍa (\"Tchen-fo-lo-pi-li\"), the title of \"King of Cashmere\". By 721/722, Baltistan had come under the influence of the Tibetan Empire. [45]\nIn 721–722, the Tibetan army attempted but failed to capture Gilgit or Bruzha ( Yasin valley ). By this time, according to Chinese records, the king of Little Palola was Mo-ching-mang ( Chinese : 沒謹忙 ; pinyin : méijǐnmáng ). He had visited the Tang court requesting military assistance against the Tibetans. [44] Between 723 and 728, the Korean Buddhist pilgrim Hyecho passed through this area. In 737/738, Tibetan troops under the leadership of Minister Bel Kyesang Dongtsab of Emperor Me Agtsom took control of Little Palola. By 747, the Chinese army under the leadership of the ethnic-Korean commander Gao Xianzhi had recaptured Little Palola. [46] Great Palola was subsequently captured by the Chinese army in 753 under military Governor Feng Changqing . However, by 755, due to the An Lushan rebellion , the Tang Chinese forces withdrew and were no longer able to exert influence in Central Asia or in the regions around Gilgit-Baltistan. [47] The control of the region was left to the Tibetan Empire. They referred to the region as Bruzha, a toponym that is consistent with the ethnonym \" Burusho \" used today. Tibetan control of the region lasted until late-800s CE. [48]\nTurkic tribes practising Zoroastrianism arrived in Gilgit during the 7th century, and founded the Trakhan dynasty in Gilgit. [39]\nMedieval history\nIn the 14th century, Sufi Muslim preachers from Persia and Central Asia introduced Islam in Baltistan. Famous amongst them was Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani , who came through Kashmir [49] while in the Gilgit region Islam entered in the same century through Turkic Tarkhan rulers. Gilgit-Baltistan was ruled by many local rulers, amongst whom the Maqpon dynasty of Skardu and the Rajas of Hunza were famous. The Maqpons of Skardu unified Gilgit-Baltistan with Chitral and Ladakh , especially in the era of Ali Sher Khan Anchan [50] who had friendly relations with the Mughal court. [51] Anchan's reign brought prosperity and entertained art, sport, and variety in architecture. He introduced polo to the Gilgit region, and sent a group of musicians from Chitral to Delhi to learn Indian music ; Mughal architecture influenced the architecture of the region as well under his reign. [52] Later Anchan in his successors Abdal Khan had great influence though in the popular literature of Baltistan, where he is still alive as a dark figure by the nickname \"Mizos\", \"man-eater\". The last Maqpon Raja, Ahmed Shah, ruled all of Baltistan between 1811 and 1840. The areas of Gilgit, Chitral and Hunza had already become independent of the Maqpons. [ citation needed ]\nBefore the demise of Shribadat , a group of Shina people migrated from Gilgit Dardistan and settled in the Dras and Kharmang areas. The descendants of those Dardic people can be still found today, and are believed to have maintained their Dardic culture and Shina language up to the present time.

Shown are the Gilgit Agency , consisting of subsidiary states of Jammu and Kashmir, and the Gilgit wazarat , including the Gilgit Leased Area (shown in white). Baltistan was part of the large area of the Ladakh-Baltistan wazarat in the east.\nThe neutrality of this section is disputed . Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page .

[54] By 1840 he conquered Skardu and captured its ruler, Ahmad Shah. Ahmad Shah was then forced to accompany Zorawar Singh on his raid into Western Tibet. Meanwhile, Baghwan Singh was appointed as administrator ( thanadar ) in Skardu. But in the following year, Ali Khan of Rondu , Haidar Khan of Shigar and Daulat Ali Khan from Khaplu led a successful uprising against the Dogras in Baltistan and captured the Dogra commander Baghwan Singh in Skardu. [55]\nIn 1842, Dogra Commander Wasir Lakhpat, with the active support of Ali Sher Khan (III) from Kartaksho , conquered Baltistan for the second time. There was a violent capture of the fortress of Kharphocho . Haidar Khan from Shigar, one of the leaders of the uprising against the Dogras, [56] was imprisoned and died in captivity. Gosaun was appointed as administrator (Thanadar) of Baltistan and till 1860, the entire region of Gilgit-Baltistan was under the Sikhs and then the Dogras . [57] [58]\nAfter the defeat of the Sikhs in the First Anglo-Sikh War , the region became a part of the Jammu and Kashmir princely state, which since 1846 had remained under the rule of the Dogras. The population in Gilgit perceived itself as ethnically different from Kashmiris and disliked being ruled by the Kashmir state. [59] The region remained with the princely state, with temporary leases of some areas assigned to the British, until 1 November 1947.\nFirst Kashmir War\nAfter Pakistan's independence, Jammu and Kashmir initially remained an independent state. Later on 22 October 1947, tribal militias backed by Pakistan crossed the border into Jammu and Kashmir after Poonch rebellion and Jammu Muslim massacre . [60] [61]\nHari Singh made a plea to India for assistance and signed the Instrument of Accession , making his state a part of India. India air-lifted troops to defend the Kashmir Valley and the invaders were pushed back behind Uri .\nGilgit's population did not favour the State's accession to India. [62] The Muslims of the frontier ilaqas (Gilgit and the adjoining hill states) had wanted to join Pakistan. [63] Sensing their discontent, Major William Brown , the Maharaja's commander of the Gilgit Scouts , mutinied on 1 November 1947, overthrowing the governor Ghansara Singh. The bloodless coup d'état was planned by Brown to the last detail under the code name \"Datta Khel\", which was also joined by a rebellious section of the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces under Mirza Hassan Khan . Brown ensured that the treasury was secured and minorities were protected. A provisional government ( Aburi Hakoomat ) was established by the Gilgit locals with Raja Shah Rais Khan as the president and Mirza Hassan Khan as the commander-in-chief. However, Major Brown had already telegraphed Khan Abdul Qayyum Khan asking Pakistan to take over. Pakistan's political agent, Khan Mohammad Alam Khan, arrived on 16 November and took over the administration of Gilgit. [64] [65] Brown outmaneuvered the pro-Independence group and secured the approval of the mirs and rajas for accession to Pakistan. [66] According to Brown,\nAlam replied [to the locals], \"you are a crowd of fools led astray by a madman. I shall not tolerate this nonsense for one instance... And when the Indian Army starts invading you there will be no use screaming to Pakistan for help, because you won't get it.\"... The provisional government faded away after this encounter with Alam Khan, clearly reflecting the flimsy and opportunistic nature of its basis and support. [67]\nThe provisional government lasted 16 days. According to scholar Yaqub Khan Bangash, it lacked sway over the population. The Gilgit rebellion did not have civilian involvement and was solely the work of military leaders, not all of whom had been in favour of joining Pakistan, at least in the short term. Historian Ahmed Hasan Dani says that although there had been a lack of public participation in the rebellion, pro-Pakistan sentiments were intense in the civilian population and their anti-Kashmiri sentiments were also clear. [68] According to various scholars, the people of Gilgit as well as those of Chilas, Koh Ghizr , Ishkoman , Yasin , Punial , Hunza and Nagar joined Pakistan by choice. [69] [70] [71] [72] [73]\nAfter taking control of Gilgit, the Gilgit Scouts along with Azad irregulars moved towards Baltistan and Ladakh and captured Skardu by May 1948. They successfully blocked Indian reinforcements sent to relieve Skardu, and proceeded towards Kargil and Leh . Indian forces mounted an offensive in the autumn of 1948 to push them back from Ladakh, but Baltistan came into the rebels' territory. [74] [75]\nOn 1 January 1948, India took the issue of Jammu and Kashmir to the United Nations Security Council . In April 1948, the Council passed a resolution calling for Pakistan to withdraw from all of Jammu and Kashmir and for India to reduce its forces to the minimum level, following which a plebiscite would be held to ascertain the people's wishes. [76] However, no withdrawal was ever carried out. India insisted that Pakistan had to withdraw first and Pakistan contended there was no guarantee that India would withdraw afterwards. [77] Gilgit-Baltistan, along with the western districts that came to be called Azad Kashmir , have remained under the control of Pakistan ever since. [78]\nInside Pakistan\nWhile the residents of Gilgit-Baltistan expressed a desire to join Pakistan after gaining independence from Maharaja Hari Singh , Pakistan declined to merge the region into itself because of the territory's link to Jammu and Kashmir . [72] For a short period after joining Pakistan, Gilgit-Baltistan was governed by Azad Kashmir if only \"theoretically, but not practically\" through its claim of being an alternative government for Jammu and Kashmir. [79] In 1949, the Government of Azad Kashmir handed over the administration of Gilgit-Baltistan to the federal government under the Karachi Agreement . According to Indian journalist Paul Sahni, this is seen as an effort by Pakistan to legitimise its rule over Gilgit-Baltistan. [80]\nAccording to Pakistani analyst Ershad Mahmud, there were two reasons why administration was transferred from Azad Kashmir to Pakistan:\nthe region was inaccessible from Azad Kashmir, and\nbecause both the governments of Azad Kashmir and Pakistan knew that the people of the region were in favour of joining Pakistan in a potential referendum over Kashmir's final status. [72]\nAccording to the International Crisis Group , the Karachi Agreement is highly unpopular in Gilgit-Baltistan because Gilgit-Baltistan was not a party to it even while it was its own fate was being decided. [81]\nFrom then until the 1990s, Gilgit-Baltistan was governed through the colonial-era Frontier Crimes Regulations , which were originally created for the northwest tribal regions . They treated tribal people as \"barbaric and uncivilised,\" levying collective fines and punishments. [82] [83] People had no right to legal representation or appeal. [84] [83] Members of tribes had to obtain prior permission from the police to travel anywhere, and had to keep the police informed about their movements. [85] [86] There was no democratic set-up during this period. All political and judicial powers remained in the hands of the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Northern Areas (KANA). The people of Gilgit-Baltistan were deprived of rights enjoyed by citizens of Pakistan and Azad Kashmir. [87]\nA primary reason for this state of affairs was the remoteness of Gilgit-Baltistan. Another factor was that the whole of Pakistan itself was deficient in democratic norms and principles, therefore the federal government did not prioritise democratic development in the region. There was also a lack of public pressure as an active civil society was absent in the region, with young educated residents usually opting to live in Pakistan's urban centers instead of staying in the region. [87]\nNorthern Areas\nIn 1970 the two parts of the territory, viz., the Gilgit Agency and Baltistan , were merged into a single administrative unit, and given the name \"Northern Areas\". [88] [ failed verification ] The Shaksgam tract was ceded by Pakistan to China following the signing of the Sino-Pakistani Frontier Agreement in 1963. [89] [90] In 1969, a Northern Areas Advisory Council (NAAC) was created, later renamed to Northern Areas Council (NAC) in 1974 and Northern Areas Legislative Council (NALC) in 1994. But it was devoid of legislative powers. All law-making was concentrated in the KANA Ministry of Pakistan. In 1994, a Legal Framework Order (LFO) was created by the KANA Ministry to serve as the de facto constitution for the region. [91] [92]\nIn 1974, the former State Subject law was abolished in Gilgit Baltistan, and Pakistanis from other areas could buy land and settle. [93]\nIn 1984 the territory's importance shot up within Pakistan with the opening of the Karakoram Highway and the region's population became more connected to mainland Pakistan. The improved connectivity facilitated the local population to avail itself of educational opportunities in the rest of Pakistan. [94] Italso allowed the political parties of Pakistan and Azad Kashmir to set up local branches, raise political awareness in the region. According to Ershad Mahmud, these Pakistani political parties have played a 'laudable role' in organising a movement for democratic rights among the residents of Gilgit-Baltistan. [87]\nIn the 1988 Gilgit Massacre , groups of Islamist Sunnis, supported by Osama bin Laden , Pervez Musharraf , General Zia-ul Haq and Mirza Aslam Beg slaughtered hundreds of local Shias. [95]\nPresent structure\nIn the late 1990s, the President of Al-Jihad Trust filed a petition in the Supreme Court of Pakistan to determine the legal status of Gilgit-Baltistan. In its judgement of 28 May 1999, the Court directed the Government of Pakistan to ensure the provision of equal rights to the people of Gilgit-Baltistan, and gave it six months to do so. Following the Supreme Court decision, the government took several steps to devolve power to the local level. However, in several policy circles, the point was raised that the Pakistani government was helpless to comply with the court verdict because of the strong political and sectarian divisions in Gilgit-Baltistan and also because of the territory's historical connection with the still disputed Kashmir region, and that this prevented the determination of Gilgit-Baltistan's real status. [96]\nA position of 'Deputy Chief Executive' was created to act as the local administrator, but the real powers still rested with the 'Chief Executive', who was the Federal Minister of KANA. \"The secretaries were more powerful than the concerned advisors,\" in the words of one commentator. In spite of various reforms packages over the years, the situation is essentially unchanged. [97] Meanwhile, public rage in Gilgit-Baltistan \"[grew] alarmingly.\" Prominent \"antagonist groups\" have mushroomed protesting the absence of civic rights and democracy. [98] The Pakistani government has debated granting provincial status to Gilgit-Baltistan. [99] Gilgit-Baltistan has been a member state of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization since 2008. [100] According to Antia Mato Bouzas, the PPP-led Pakistani government has attempted a compromise through its 2009 reforms between its traditional stand on the Kashmir dispute and the demands of locals, most of whom may have pro-Pakistan sentiments. While the 2009 reforms have added to the self-identification of the region, they have not resolved the constitutional status of the region within Pakistan. [101]\nAccording to 2010 news reports, the people of Gilgit-Baltistan want to merge into Pakistan as a separate fifth province. [22] [23] However, as of 2015 leaders of Azad Kashmir were opposed to any step towards integrating Gilgit-Baltistan into Pakistan. [102] The people of Gilgit-Baltistan have opposed integration with Azad Kashmir. They desire Pakistani citizenship and a constitutional status for their region. [22] [23]\nIn 2016, for the first time in the country's Constitution, Gilgit-Baltistan had been mentioned by name. [103]\nIn September 2020, it was reported that Pakistan decided to elevate Gilgit-Baltistan's status to that of a full-fledged province. [104] [105]\nGovernment\nMain article: Government of Gilgit-Baltistan\nGilgit Baltisan assembly located in Jutial Gilgit\nThe territory of present-day Gilgit-Baltistan became a separate administrative unit in 1970 under the name \"Northern Areas\". It was formed by the amalgamation of the former Gilgit Agency , the Baltistan District of the Ladakh Wazarat and the hill states of Hunza and Nagar . It presently consists of fourteen districts, [9] [106] has a population approaching one million and an area of approximately 73,000 square kilometres (28,000 square miles), and shares borders with Pakistan, China, Afghanistan, and India. In 1993, an attempt was made by the High Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir to annex Gilgit-Baltistan but was quashed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan after protests by the locals of Gilgit-Baltistan, who feared domination by the Kashmiris. [24]\nGovernment of Pakistan abolished State Subject Rule in Gilgit-Baltistan in 1974, which resulted in demographic changes in the territory. [107] [108] While administratively controlled by Pakistan since the First Kashmir War , Gilgit-Baltistan has never been formally integrated into the Pakistani state and does not participate in Pakistan's constitutional political affairs. [109] [110] On 29 August 2009, the Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order 2009, was passed by the Pakistani cabinet and later signed by the then President of Pakistan\nAsif Ali Zardari . [111] The order granted self-rule to the people of Gilgit-Baltistan, by creating, among other things, an elected Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly and Gilgit-Baltistan Council . Gilgit-Baltistan thus gained a de facto province-like status without constitutionally becoming part of Pakistan. [109] [112] Currently, Gilgit-Baltistan is neither a province nor a state. It has a semi-provincial status. [113] Officially, the Pakistan government had rejected Gilgit-Baltistani calls for integration with Pakistan on the grounds that it would jeopardise its demands for the whole Kashmir issue to be resolved according to UN resolutions. [24] Some Kashmiri nationalist groups, such as the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front , claim Gilgit-Baltistan as part of a future independent state to match what existed in 1947. [24] India, on the other hand, maintains that Gilgit-Baltistan is a part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir that is \"an integral part of the country [India].\" [114]\nThe Gilgit-Baltistan Police (GBP) is responsible for law enforcement in Gilgit-Baltistan. The mission of the force is the prevention and detection of crime, maintenance of law and order and enforcement of the Constitution of Pakistan.\nRegions\nGilgit-Baltistan is administered as three divisions\nFourteen districts in 2019\nGilgit-Baltistan is administratively divided into three divisions: Baltistan, Diamer and Gilgit, [115] which, in turn, are divided into fourteen districts.

The estimated population of Gilgit-Baltistan was about 1.8 million in 2015 [19] and the overall population growth rate between 1998 and 2011 was 63.1% making it 4.85% annually. [118] [119]\nSecurity\nSecurity in Gilgit-Baltistan is provided by the Gilgit-Baltistan Police, the Gilgit Baltistan Scouts (a paramilitary force), and the Northern Light Infantry (part of the Pakistani Army).\nGeography and climate\nMain article: Geography of Gilgit-Baltistan\nNaltar Lakes\nNaltar Lake or Bashkiri Lake-I\nNaltar Lake or Bashkiri Lake-II\nAzure coloured water of Naltar Lake III\nSurface elevation = 3050–3150 m [ citation needed ]\nGilgit-Baltistan borders Pakistan's Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province to the west, a small portion of the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan to the north, China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region to the northeast, the Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir to the southeast, and the Pakistani-administered state of Azad Jammu and Kashmir to the south.\nGilgit-Baltistan is home to all five of Pakistan's \" eight-thousanders \" and to more than fifty peaks above 7,000 metres (23,000 ft). Gilgit and Skardu are the two main hubs for expeditions to those mountains. The region is home to some of the world's highest mountain ranges. The main ranges are the Karakoram and the western Himalayas . The Pamir Mountains are to the north, and the Hindu Kush lies to the west. Amongst the highest mountains are K2 (Mount Godwin-Austen) and Nanga Parbat , the latter being one of the most feared mountains in the world.\nThree of the world's longest glaciers outside the polar regions are found in Gilgit-Baltistan: the Biafo Glacier , the Baltoro Glacier , and the Batura Glacier . There are, in addition, several high-altitude lakes in Gilgit-Baltistan:\nSheosar Lake in the Deosai Plains , Skardu\nNaltar lakes in the Naltar Valley , Gilgit\nSatpara Tso Lake in Skardu , Baltistan\nKatzura Tso Lake in Skardu , Baltistan\nZharba Tso Lake in Shigar , Baltistan\nPhoroq Tso Lake in Skardu, Baltistan\nLake Kharfak in Gangche , Baltistan\nByarsa Tso Lake in Gultari , Astore\nBorith Lake in Gojal , upper Hunza , Gilgit\nRama Lake near Astore\nRush Lake near Nagar , Gilgit\nKromber Lake at Kromber Pass, Ishkoman Valley , Ghizer District\nBarodaroksh Lake in Bar Valley, Nagar\nGhorashi Lake in Ghandus Valley, Kharmang\nThe Deosai Plains are located above the tree line and constitute the second-highest plateau in the world after Tibet , at 4,115 metres (13,501 ft). The plateau lies east of Astore, south of Skardu and west of Ladakh . The area was declared as a national park in 1993. The Deosai Plains cover an area of almost 5,000 square kilometres (1,900 sq mi). For over half the year (between September and May), Deosai is snow-bound and cut off from rest of Astore and Baltistan in winters. The village of Deosai lies close to Chilum chokki and is connected with the Kargil district of Ladakh through an all-weather road.\nSatpara Lake , Skardu , in 2002\nUpper Kachura Lake\nShangrila Lake , Skardu\nManthokha Waterfall\nRock art and petroglyphs\nThere are more than 50,000 pieces of rock art ( petroglyphs ) and inscriptions all along the Karakoram Highway in Gilgit-Baltistan, concentrated at ten major sites between Hunza and Shatial . The carvings were left by invaders, traders, and pilgrims who passed along the trade route, as well as by locals. The earliest date back to between 5000 and 1000 BCE , showing single animals, triangular men and hunting scenes in which the animals are larger than the hunters. These carvings were pecked into the rock with stone tools and are covered with a thick patina that proves their age.\nThe ethnologist\nKarl Jettmar  [ de ] has pieced together the history of the area from inscriptions and recorded his findings in Rock Carvings and Inscriptions in the Northern Areas of Pakistan [120] and the later-released Between Gandhara and the Silk Roads — Rock Carvings Along the Karakoram Highway . [121] Many of these carvings and inscriptions will be inundated and/or destroyed when the planned Basha-Diamir dam is built and the Karakoram Highway is widened.\nClimate\nMountains covered in snow, as seen from the Raja Bazar Road Gilgit\nGlacier in Gilgit Baltistan\nThe climate of Gilgit-Baltistan varies from region to region, since the surrounding mountain ranges create sharp variations in weather. The eastern part has the moist zone of the western Himalayas, but going toward Karakoram and Hindu Kush , the climate gets considerably drier. [122]\nThere are towns like Gilgit and Chilas that are very hot during the day in summer yet cold at night and valleys like Astore , Khaplu , Yasin , Hunza , and Nagar , where the temperatures are cold even in summer. [123]\nClimate Change Effects\nMain article: 2022 Gilgit-Baltistan floods\nClimate change has adversely effected this region with more rains every year. On 26 August 2022, most villages in Ghizer district and Hunza were severely effected by the ongoing flooding displacing many people.\nEconomy and resources\nMontage of Gilgit-Baltistan\nSee also: Education in Gilgit-Baltistan\nThe economy of the region is primarily based on a traditional trade route, the historic Silk Road . The China Trade Organization forum led the people of the area to actively invest and learn modern trade know-how from their Chinese neighbour, Xinjiang . [ citation needed ] Later, the establishment of a chamber of commerce and the Sust\ndry port in Gojal Hunza are milestones. The rest of the economy is shouldered by mainly agriculture and tourism. Agricultural products are wheat, corn (maize), barley, and fruits. Tourism is mostly in trekking and mountaineering , and this industry is growing in importance. [124] [125]\nIn early September 2009, Pakistan signed an agreement with the People's Republic of China for a major energy project in Gilgit-Baltistan which includes the construction of a 7,000-megawatt dam at Bunji in the Astore District . [112]\nMountaineering\nView of Laila Peak , which is located near Hushe Valley (a town in Khaplu )\nThe Trango Towers offer some of the largest cliffs and most challenging rock climbing in the world, and every year a number of expeditions from all corners of the globe visit Karakoram to climb the challenging granite. [126]\nGilgit-Baltistan is home to more than 20 peaks of over 6,100 metres (20,000 ft), including K-2 the second highest mountain on Earth. [127] Other well known peaks include Masherbrum (also known as K1), Broad Peak , Hidden Peak , Gasherbrum II , Gasherbrum IV , and Chogolisa , situated in Khaplu Valley . The following peaks have so far been scaled by various expeditions:\nName of Peak\nPhotos\nHeight\nFirst known ascent\nLocation\n1. K-2\n(28,250 ft)\n31 July 1954\nKarakoram\n2.

Through the importation of gas cylinders from other provinces, many private gas contractors offer gas cylinders. The LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) Air Mix Plant project by Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited was unveiled in 2020 with the goal of bringing the gas facility to Gilgit. This will significantly reduce deforestation as public uses wood from trees for heating and lighting purpose. The first head office has been built in Gilgit City. [128]\nTourism\nMain article: Tourism in Gilgit-Baltistan\nCold Desert, Skardu is the world's highest desert\nRush Lake , Nagar, Pakistan\nSheosar Lake is in the western part of Deosai National Park\nGilgit Baltistan is the capital of tourism in Pakistan . Gilgit Baltistan is home to some of the highest peaks in the world, including K2 the second highest peak in the world. Gilgit Baltistan's landscape includes mountains, lakes, glaciers and valleys. Gilgit Baltistan is not only known for its mountains — it is also visited for its landmarks, culture, history and people. [129] K2 Basecamp, Deosai , Naltar , Fairy Meadows\nBagrot Valley and Hushe valley are common places to visit in Gilgit Baltistan. [130]\nTransport\nMain article: Provincial Highways of Gilgit-Baltistan\nThe Karakoram Highway\nNational Highway N-15 has abrupt direction changes which is a challenge for drivers who use this route to reach Gilgit\nBefore 1978, Gilgit-Baltistan was cut off from the rest of the Pakistan and the world due to the harsh terrain and the lack of accessible roads. All of the roads to the south opened toward the Pakistan-administered state of Azad Kashmir and to the southeast toward the present-day Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. During the summer, people could walk across the mountain passes to travel to Rawalpindi . The fastest way to travel was by air, but air travel was accessible only to a few privileged local people and to Pakistani military and civilian officials. Then, with the assistance of the Chinese government, Pakistan began construction of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), which was completed in 1978. The journey from Rawalpindi / Islamabad to Gilgit takes approximately 20 to 24 hours.\nThe Karakoram Highway connects Islamabad to Gilgit and Skardu , which are the two major hubs for mountaineering expeditions in Gilgit-Baltistan. Northern Areas Transport Corporation (NATCO) offers bus and jeep transport service to the two hubs and several other popular destinations, lakes, and glaciers in the area. Landslides on the Karakoram Highway are very common. The Karakoram Highway connects Gilgit to Tashkurgan Town , Kashgar, China via Sust , the customs and health-inspection post on the Gilgit-Baltistan side, and the Khunjerab Pass , the highest paved international border crossing in the world at 4,693 metres (15,397 ft).\nIn March 2006, the respective governments announced that, commencing on 1 June 2006, a thrice-weekly bus service would begin across the boundary from Gilgit to Kashgar and road-widening work would begin at 600 kilometres (370 mi) of the Karakoram Highway. There would also be one daily bus in each direction between the Sust and Taxkorgan border areas of the two political entities. [131]\nATR 42–500 on Gilgit Airport. Picture taken on 10 July 2016\nPakistan International Airlines used to fly a Fokker F27 Friendship daily between Gilgit Airport and Benazir Bhutto International Airport . The flying time was approximately 50 minutes, and the flight was one of the most scenic in the world, as its route passed over Nanga Parbat , a mountain whose peak is higher than the aircraft's cruising altitude. However, the Fokker F27 was retired after a crash at Multan in 2006. Currently, flights are being operated by PIA to Gilgit on the brand-new ATR 42–500 , which was purchased in 2006. With the new plane, the cancellation of flights is much less frequent. Pakistan International Airlines also offers regular flights of a Boeing 737 between Skardu and Islamabad. All flights are subject to weather clearance; in winter, flights are often delayed by several days.\nA railway through the region has been proposed; see Khunjerab Railway for details.\nDemographics\nPopulation\nThe population of Gilgit Baltistan is 1,492,924 as of 2017. [1] The estimated population of Gilgit-Baltistan in 2013 was 1.249 million, [28] [29] and it was 873,000 in 1998. [132] Approximately 14% of the population was urban. [133] The fertility rate is 4.7 children per woman, which is the highest in Pakistan. [134]\nThe population of Gilgit-Baltistan consists of many diverse linguistic, ethnic, and religious sects, due in part to the many isolated valleys separated by some of the world's highest mountains. The ethnic groups include Shins , Yashkuns , Kashmiris, Kashgaris, Pamiris, Pathans, and Kohistanis. [135] A significant number of people from Gilgit-Baltistan are residing in other parts of Pakistan, mainly in Punjab and Karachi . The literacy rate of Gilgit-Baltistan is approximately 72%.\nIn 2017 census, Gilgit District has the highest population of 330,000 and Hunza District the lowest of 50,000. [132]\nLanguages\nGilgit-Baltistan is a multilingual region where Urdu being a national and official language serves as the lingua franca for inter ethnic communications. English is co-official and also used in education, while Arabic is used for religious purposes. The table below shows a break-up of Gilgit-Baltistan first-language speakers.\nRank\nLanguage\nDetail [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] [143]\n1\nShina\nIt is a Dardic language spoken by the majority in six tehsil s (Gilgit, Diamir/Chilas, Darel/Tangir, Astore, Puniyal/Gahkuch and Rondu).\n2\nBalti\nIt is spoken by the majority in five tehsil s (Skardu/Shigar, Kharmang, Gultari, Khaplu and Mashabrum). It is from the Tibetan language family and has Urdu borrowings.\n3\nBurushaski\nIt is spoken by the majority in four tehsil s (Nagar 1, Hunza/Aliabad, Nagar II, and Yasin). It is a language isolate that has borrowed considerable Urdu vocabulary.\n4\nKhowar\nIt is spoken by the majority in two tehsil s (Gupis and Ishkomen) but also spoken in Yasin and Puniyal/Gahkuch Tehsils. Like Shina, it is a Dardic language.\n5\nWakhi\nIt is spoken by the majority of people in Gojal Tehsil of Hunza. But it is also spoken in the Yasin and Ishkomen tehsils of Gupis-Yasin and Ghizer districts. It is classified as eastern Iranian/ Pamiri language.\nOthers\nPashto , Kashmiri , Domaaki (spoken by musician clans in the region) and Gojri languages are also spoken by a significant population of the region.\nReligion\nA pie chart showing the Sectarian divide of Gilgit-Baltistan\nSectarian divide of Gilgit-Baltistan [144]\nSects\nPercent\nShia\n \n39.85%\nSunni\n \n30.05%\nIsmaili\n \n24%\nNoorbakhshis\n \n6.1%\nThe population of Gilgit-Baltistan is entirely Muslim and is denominationally the most diverse in the country. The region is also the only Shia-plurality area in an otherwise Sunni-dominant Pakistan. [145] People in the Skardu district are mostly Shia, while Diamir and Astore districts have Sunni majorities. Ghanche has a Noorbakhshi population, and Ghizar has an Ismaili majority. [146] The populations in Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar districts are composed of a mix of all of these sects. [144] According to Indian government official , B. Raman , the Shias and Ismailis constituted about 85% of the population in 1948. [147] [note 5] Raman claims the proportion was brought down by General Zia ul-Haq through a conscious policy of demographic change by encouraging the migration of Sunnis from other provinces and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , in an effort to counter the growing sectarian consciousness of the Shias after the Iranian Revolution in 1979. [147] Recent surveys show that Shia Ismaili women, both rural and urban, have high rates of contraceptives usage and low fertility rates; by contrast Sunni women, especially in rural areas, have low rates of contraceptive usage and high fertility rates.

It is widely made in Nagar Valley and Hunza Valley\nGilgit-Baltistan is home to diversified cultures, ethnic groups, languages and backgrounds. [153] Major cultural events include the Shandoor Polo Festival, Babusar Polo Festival and Jashn-e-Baharan or the Harvest Time Festival (Navroz). [153] Traditional dances include: Old Man Dance in which more than one person wears old-style dresses; Cow Boy Dance (Payaloo) in which a person wears old style dress, long leather shoes and holds a stick in hand and the Sword Dance in which the participants show taking one sword in right and shield in left. One to six participants can dance in pairs.\nSports\nPolo in progress with the shandur lake in background, Shandur , Gupis-Yasin District .\nMany types of sports are in currency, throughout the region, but most popular of them is Polo . [154] [155] Almost every bigger valley has a polo ground, polo matches in such grounds attract locals as well as foreigners visitors during summer season. One of such polo tournament is held in Shandur each year and polo teams of Gilgit with Chitral participates. [156] Though very internationally unlikely, but even for some local historians like Hassan Hasrat from Skardu and for some national writers like Ahmed Hasan Dani it was originated in same region. [157] For testimonies, they present the Epic of King Gesar of balti version where king gesar started polo by killing his step son and hit head of cadaver with a stick thus started the game [158] they also held that the very simple rules of local polo game also testifies its primitiveness. The English word Polo has Balti origin, that is spoken in same region, dates back to the 19th century which means ball. [159] [160]\nOther popular sports are football , cricket , volleyball (mostly play in winters) and other minor local sports. with growing facilities and particular local geography Climbing, trekking and other similar sports are also getting popularity. Samina Baig from Hunza valley is the only Pakistani woman and the third Pakistani to climb Mount Everest and also the youngest Muslim woman to climb Everest, having done so at the age of 21 while Hassan Sadpara from Skardu valley is the first Pakistani to have climbed six eight-thousanders including the world's highest peak Everest (8848 m) besides K2 (8611 m), Gasherbrum I (8080 m), Gasherbrum II (8034 m), Nanga Parbat (8126 m), Broad Peak (8051 m).\nNotable people\nAmen Aamir , first woman from Gilgit-Baltistan to qualify as a pilot\nSee also\nGeography portal\nAsia portal\nPakistan portal\nNorthern Pakistan\nBalti language\nBalti people\nList of cities in Gilgit Baltistan\nList of cultural heritage sites in Gilgit-Baltistan\nList of mountains in Pakistan\nNotes\n^\nThe Indian government and Indian sources refer to Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan as \"Pakistan-occupied Kashmir\" (\"PoK\") [14] or \"Pakistan-held Kashmir\" (\"PhK\"). [15] Sometimes Azad Kashmir alone is meant by these terms. [14] \"Pakistan-administered Kashmir\" and \"Pakistan-controlled Kashmir\" [16] [17] are used by neutral sources.

It is not one of Wikipedia's policies or guidelines , and may reflect varying levels of consensus and vetting .\nShortcuts\nWP:MTR\nH:MTR\nThis page in a nutshell: If you have the ability, please boldly assist Wikipedia by fixing the issues flagged by maintenance templates! All problems on Wikipedia are resolved through the efforts of volunteers like you. If you understand the problem that the template highlights, such as by reading the explanatory links it contains or have found guidance through this page – and have reasonably fixed the issues – you may simply remove the maintenance template; it will NOT be removed automatically.\nLegitimate Wikipedia editors will never offer to remove maintenance templates in exchange for money. See the paid editing scam warning for more information.\nMany Wikipedia pages display maintenance templates that identify problems. You may have arrived at this help page after clicking a link on a maintenance template saying \" Learn how and when to remove this template message \".\nMaintenance templates are added and removed by volunteers. This help page explains the process for examining and removing such templates.\nOverview\nMaintenance templates (or \"tags\") are not removed automatically. Even if you fix the issue(s) described in a maintenance template, the tag will remain in the article until you or someone else manually removes it . The mechanics of removal are usually as simple as clicking \"Edit\" at the top of the page or in the section involved (if you're not already in edit mode), removing the code that produces the display of the template, leaving an edit summary and saving the page.\nIt is not okay to remove maintenance templates until the issue flagged by the template is remedied first—that is, only once the maintenance tag is no longer valid unless it truly did not belong in the first place.\nWikipedia works because of the efforts of volunteers just like you, making bold edits to help build this encyclopedia. Fixing problems and then removing maintenance templates when you are done is important in that effort.\nAddressing the flagged problem\nShortcuts\nWP:TEMPREMOVE\nH:TEMPREMOVE\nWe don't know which maintenance tag brought you to this page, and thus what specific problem needs attention. However, every maintenance template contains links to help pages, policies, guidelines, or other relevant pages that provide information on the problem the template was placed to flag. You will also find guidance on some of the more common templates below .\nMany common templates address problems with article citations and references, or their lack  – because reliable sourcing is the lifeblood of Wikipedia articles and at the core of all of Wikipedia's content policies and guidelines, such as notability , verifiability , neutral point of view , and no original research . But a host of other issues may be flagged, including tone and style of writing , structure, and formatting , lack of links to or from other articles, compliance with Wikipedia's manual of style and the lack of a lead section .\nPlease make sure the issue has been resolved before removing the template. That does require some effort on your part—to understand both the problem and how to solve it.\nAn example\nIf the issue flagged by the maintenance template is that the article contains no references, a citation needed template used might be {{ Unreferenced }} – typically placed by the code you would see when wikitext (source) editing: {{Unreferenced|date=April 2023}} .\nIt is important to understand that what you see when reading an article, and what you see when editing it, are different. Thus, the above code, only seen when doing source editing, results in the display of the ' called ' template below:\nExample:\nThis article does not cite any sources . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . Find sources:   \"Maintenance template removal\"  –  news   ·\nnewspapers   ·\nbooks   ·\nscholar   ·\nJSTOR\n( April 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )\nThis template contains several links , indicated by the words and phrases in blue. Three of these links are to pages that, when explored, provide context and resources for you to understand why the template was placed on the page, and how to address the issue of the article being unreferenced :\n\"cite\", which links to the content guideline Wikipedia:Citing sources ;\n\"sources\", which links to the policy Wikipedia:Verifiability ; and\n\"adding citations to reliable sources\", which links to a help page providing a how-to guide to the basics of citing references .\nWhatever maintenance tag brought you to this help page should likewise contain relevant explanatory links addressed to whatever its issue is . Read these explanatory and contextual pages to learn about the problem and what it is you need to do to take care of it. Again, some of the more common maintenance templates seen are addressed in the specific template guidance section below .\nWhen to remove\nShortcut\nWP:WTRMT\nMaintenance templates are not meant to be in articles permanently. Any user without a conflict of interest may remove a maintenance template in any of the following circumstances:\nWhen the issue has been adequately addressed;\nUpon determining that the issue has been resolved (perhaps by someone else);\nIf it reasonably appears that the template did not belong when placed or was added in error. Consider first discussing the matter with the original placer of the template (unless this user is no longer active on Wikipedia). In any case, if the issue appears contentious, seek consensus on the talk page ;\nWhen an article talk page discussion has not been initiated (for templates requesting it);\nWhen there is consensus on the talk page (or elsewhere) as to how to address the flagged issue, and you are reasonably implementing those changes. (It is good practice to note the location of the consensus in the edit summary accompanying your removal, ideally with a link to the location);\nWhen it can reasonably be concluded that the template is no longer relevant, such as a {{ Current }} template appearing in an article that no longer documents a current event;\nIf the maintenance template is of a type that requires support but is not fully supported. For example, neutrality-related templates such as {{ COI }} (associated with the conflict of interest guideline ) or {{ POV }} (associated with the neutral point of view policy ) strongly recommend that the tagging editor initiate a discussion (generally on the article's talk page) to support the placement of the tag. If the tagging editor failed to do so, or the discussion is dormant, and there is no other support for the template, it can be removed;\nYou may remove a template when according to your best judgment the lack of edits and/or talk page discussion should be interpreted as the issue not worth fixing (as a form of \" silent consensus \"). Please note there is currently no consensus for general age-related removal of maintenance templates – that is, removing a template purely or chiefly because it is old is not considered a sufficient argument. Exception: removing POV-related templates whose discussions have gone dormant is encouraged, as addressed in the bullet point immediately above;\nLastly, there are times when a person attempting to address a maintenance template that flags some fundamental matter may find that the issue cannot actually be addressed. For example, if an article is flagged as lacking citations to reliable , secondary sources, written by third-parties to the topic, and a user seeing the maintenance templates discovers that such sources appear not to exist , that usually means the article should be deleted . In such cases, it is not so much that the template does not belong and should be removed, but rather that flagging the page for maintenance will never address the more critical issue that the page itself does not belong on Wikipedia at all.\nWhen not to remove\nShortcuts\nWP:WNTRMT\nWP:MAINTENANCEDISAGREEMENT\nYou should not remove maintenance templates if any of the following apply:\nYou do not understand the issues raised by the template;\nThe issue has not yet been resolved;\nThere is ongoing activity or discussion related to the template issue;\nThe problem that the maintenance template flags is plainly and unambiguously required for a proper article under Wikipedia's policies and guidelines ;\nYou have been paid to edit the article or have some other conflict of interest [exceptions apply: see individual template documentation].\nRemoval\nHave you carefully read the help pages and thoroughly fixed the problem? Or have you made a considered decision that the template is not, or is no longer, applicable? Great! Now, to remove the maintenance template:\nEither click on \"edit\" or \"edit source\" at the top of the page, or if the maintenance template is not at the top but somewhere in the body of the article, you might instead use a section edit link ;\nIf you are editing wikitext (\"source\" editing) : Delete the template code. The template code you see in this edit mode will usually be in the following form, as in the example above: {{Name of template|date=Month Year}} . If you are editing using VisualEditor : Click on the template (tag), which will then turn blue. Press the \"Delete\" or backspace key on your keyboard.\nLeave a descriptive edit summary , e.g., \"Removed [ insert the name of template ] because I have fixed the issue;\"\nClick Publish changes .\nThat's it. Thank you!\nChanging a template\nProblems flagged by some templates may imply secondary problems that will still exist after you take care of the main issue. In such cases, it may be more appropriate to switch the template to another applicable one following your edits, rather than just removing it. The reasoning behind the change in templates should be addressed in the edit summary .\nA case in point is the {{Unreferenced}} template example used above. It is placed on pages with no references . Thus, adding just one suitable reference renders that maintenance template inapplicable. However, that change does not take care of the overarching issue of poor sourcing . In this example, a change to a different template may be appropriate, depending on the type, quality, depth, and manner of sourcing added to fix the issue, such as {{ refimprove }} , {{ No footnotes }} , {{ Primary sources }} , or one of the many others listed at Wikipedia:Template messages/Sources of articles .\nConversely, some templates flag highly discrete issues where there is no need to consider a switch to another template. For example, if an article is \" orphaned \" – no other articles in the main article namespace link to it – then once that is taken care of (by the addition of links to it from other articles), the issue is gone entirely and the tag's removal is unambiguous.\nWhen a flagged issue has been addressed in parts of an article but remains in discrete sections, clarity may be served by replacing the template with a section variant, or by use of inline cleanup tags , if such versions of the template exist.\nIn some cases, it may be helpful to request a review of a maintenance template's removal or proposed removal with the editor who initially added it to the article at issue.\nSpecific template guidance\nThis section guides you on how to address some of the more common specific templates that may have brought you to this help page. More detailed information about the templates can be found by following the links to the templates themselves.\nClick \"show\" at the right to display the instructions.\n{{ Multiple issues }}\nSome articles will be flagged for multiple discrete problems using a single template: {{ Multiple issues }} . If you take care of one or more problems that it flags but not all , do not remove the template entirely but just those parameters in it that you have fixed. The example below shows three different issues flagged by this template:\n{{Multiple issues| {{Orphan|date=January 2008}} {{POV|date=June 2009}} {{One source|date=March 2011}} }}\nIf you address the \"orphaning\" issue, but not the other two, remove just the line that flagged the orphan issue and leave the others intact. Thus, your removal would leave the template in this state.\n{{Multiple issues| {{POV|date=June 2009}} {{One source|date=March 2011}} }}\nSee the sections below for how to address some of the more common problems flagged by templates that may be wrapped into this template.\n{{ Unreferenced }}\nAll of Wikipedia's core content policies and guidelines have as a common denominator the need for reliable sourcing. For example, the content of Wikipedia articles must be verifiable in reliable sources ; the notability of a topic demonstrated through such reliable sources that are secondary in nature, which are independent of the topic and treat the subject in substantive detail (not just \"mere mentions\"); and to establish that the content is not original research , the sources cited must directly support the material being presented without analysis or synthesis to reach or imply a conclusion that is not stated in the sources.\n{{ Unreferenced }} , typically placed by the code {{Unreferenced|date=April 2023}} , having redirects such as {{Unsourced}}, {{Unverified}}, {{No references}}, {{No sources}}, and {{Unref}}, and displaying when reading as:\nThis article does not cite any sources .

This template no longer applies once a single reference appears in the article, whether placed through the preferred method of inline citations , ones appearing in a general references section, or even through such a poor method as including an embedded raw link .\nTo address the issue, add citations to reliable sources . Because of their importance, Wikipedia contains numerous instruction pages on aspects of referencing. We suggest starting with Help:Referencing for beginners and Help:Introduction to referencing/1 , and then seeing Wikipedia:Citing sources for a more involved treatment, noting that each contains see also sections linking to additional help pages, guides, and tutorials. A visual guide to placing inline citations through <ref> ... </ref> tags may also help, and appears below.\nVisual inline citation guide\nFormatting references using inline citations\nAll information in Wikipedia articles should be verified by citations to reliable sources . Our preferred method of citation is using the \" cite.php \" form of inline citations, using the <ref></ref> elements. Using this method, each time a particular source is mined for information ( don't copy word-for-word !), a footnote is placed in the text (\"inline\"), that takes one to the detail of the source when clicked, set forth in a references section after the text of the article.\nIn brief, anywhere you want a footnote to appear in a piece of text, you place an opening <ref> tag followed by the text of the citation which you want to appear at the bottom of the article, and close with a </ref> tag. Note the closing slash (\"/\"). For multiple use of a single reference, the opening ref tag is given a name, like so: <ref name=\"name\"> followed by the citation text and a closing </ref> tag. Each time you want to use that footnote again, you simply use the first element with a slash, like so: <ref name=\"name\" />.\nFor these references to appear, you must tell the software where to display them, using either the code <references/> or, most commonly, the template, {{ Reflist }} which can be modified to display the references in columns using {{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}.

Depending on the type, quality, depth, and manner of sourcing added to fix the issue, you might replace it with {{ refimprove }} , {{ No footnotes }} , {{ Primary sources }} or a host of others listed at Wikipedia:Template messages/Sources of articles .\n{{ Refimprove }}\nAll of Wikipedia's core content policies and guidelines have as a common denominator the need for reliable sourcing.

It should not be used for articles with no sources at all ( {{ unreferenced }} should be used instead), nor for articles without inline citations but which contain some sources ( {{ No footnotes }} should be used instead), nor for an article on living persons ( {{ BLP sources }} should be used instead). This template no longer applies once an article has been made fairly well-sourced.\nTo address the issue, add additional inline citations to reliable sources for all significant statements in the article. Whether or not an article has been rendered \"fairly well sourced\" may involve a judgment call, but in any event, the sources used must be reliable ones, and articles should not rely predominantly on primary sources , but rather on secondary sources. Note the minimum : all quotations, material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, and contentious material, whether negative, positive, or neutral, about living persons, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material.\n{{ No footnotes }}\nAll of Wikipedia's core content policies and guidelines have a common denominator: the need for reliable sourcing. For example, the content of Wikipedia articles must be verifiable in reliable sources ; the notability of a topic demonstrated through such reliable sources that are secondary in nature, which are independent of the topic and treat the subject in substantive detail (not just \"mere mentions\"); and to establish that the content is not original research , the sources cited must directly support the material being presented without analysis or synthesis to reach or imply a conclusion that is not stated in the sources.\n{{ No footnotes }} , typically placed by the code {{No footnotes|date=April 2023}} , and having redirects such as {{Citations}}, {{No citations}}, {{Inline citations}} and {{No inline citations}}, and displaying when reading as:\nThis article includes a list of references , related reading , or external links , but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations .

Inline citations make verifiability accessible. In short, in the absence of an inline citation that associates specific material to a specific source, it becomes very difficult for a reader to check what sources, given in only some general manner, verify what items of content.\nTo address the issue, add inline citations to reliable sources , ideally for all significant statements in the article. Note that at a minimum : all quotations, material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, and contentious material, whether negative, positive, or neutral, about living persons, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material.\nThere are many instruction pages that directly and indirectly give guidance on adding inline citations. We suggest starting with Help:Referencing for beginners and Help:Introduction to referencing/1 , and then seeing Wikipedia:Citing sources for a more involved treatment, noting that each contains see also sections linking to additional help pages, guides, and tutorials. A visual guide to placing inline citations through <ref> ... </ref> tags may also help, and appears below.\nVisual inline citation guide\nFormatting references using inline citations\nAll information in Wikipedia articles should be verified by citations to reliable sources . Our preferred method of citation is using the \" cite.php \" form of inline citations, using the <ref></ref> elements. Using this method, each time a particular source is mined for information ( don't copy word-for-word !), a footnote is placed in the text (\"inline\"), that takes one to the detail of the source when clicked, set forth in a references section after the text of the article.\nIn brief, anywhere you want a footnote to appear in a piece of text, you place an opening <ref> tag followed by the text of the citation which you want to appear at the bottom of the article, and close with a </ref> tag.

Each time you want to use that footnote again, you simply use the first element with a slash, like so: <ref name=\"name\" />.\nFor these references to appear, you must tell the software where to display them, using either the code <references/> or, most commonly, the template, {{ Reflist }} which can be modified to display the references in columns using {{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}.

They should not be used to support content that presents interpretation, analysis, evaluation, or synthesis, and should not be the predominant form of sourcing in an article. Moreover, primary sources are generally not useful to demonstrate a topic's notability .\nTo address the issue, add citations predominantly to secondary sources . Often this involves replacing some of the primary sources with secondary sources, and not just adding them alongside existing ones—especially where the primary source is being used for an invalid purpose such as interpretive claims and synthesis.\nFinding secondary sources is a large topic but make use of Google Books, News, and Scholar; find local newspaper archives; go to a library; if you have access, use pay/subscription services like JSTOR, Newspaperarchive.com; Ancestry.com, etc.; see our guide on free English newspaper sources and others listed here ; request access to pay/prescription sources at WP:RX . If insufficient reliable secondary and independent sources exist treating a topic in substantive detail, then Wikipedia should not have an article on the topic. Remember that no amount of editing can overcome a lack of notability .\n{{ Notability }}\nWikipedia is an encyclopedia , a specific type of reference work properly containing articles on topics of knowledge. Wikipedia employs the concept of notability to avoid indiscriminate inclusion of topics by attempting to ensure that the subjects of articles are \"worthy of notice\" – by only including articles on topics that the world has taken note of by substantively treating them in reliable sources unconnected with the topic.\nThe general notability standard thus presumes that topics are notable if they have \"received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject \".\n{{ Notability }} , typically placed by the code {{Notability|date=April 2023}} , having redirects such as {{Notable}}, {{Non-notable}}, {{Nn}} and {{Significance}}, and displaying when reading as:\nThe topic of this article may not meet Wikipedia's general notability guideline . Please help to demonstrate the notability of the topic by citing reliable secondary sources that are independent of the topic and provide significant coverage of it beyond a mere trivial mention. If notability cannot be shown, the article is likely to be merged , redirected , or deleted .

As stated in the template, addressing the issue requires adding citations to reliable secondary sources. There are several common mistakes seen in addressing this issue:\nAdding citations but to unreliable sources : We are looking for treatment in sources like mainstream newspaper articles, non-vanity books, magazines, scholarly journals, television and radio documentaries, etc. – sources with editorial oversight and a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. This means generally not random personal websites, blogs, forum posts, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, self-published sources like open wikis (including other Wikipedia articles ), etc. In short, read and understand Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources .\nAdding citations to connected (non-independent) sources : While primary sources may be useful to verify certain facts, they must be used with caution and do nothing to establish notability. In short, we are looking for secondary sources written by third parties to a topic.\nAdding citations to sources that merely mention the topic : You can cite numerous reliable, secondary, independent sources and it will not help establish notability if they do not treat the topic substantively – think generally two paragraphs of text focused on the topic at issue. Remember: it is much better to cite two good sources that treat a topic in detail, than twenty that just mention it in passing. Moreover, citation overkill to sources containing mere passing mentions of the topic is a badge of a non-notable topic and, if good sources are present in the mix, they will be hidden among these others from those seeking to assess a topic's demonstration of notability.\nIf insufficient reliable secondary and independent sources exist treating a topic in substantive detail, then Wikipedia should not have an article on the topic. Remember that no amount of editing can overcome a lack of notability .\n{{ Advert }}\n{{ Advert }} , typically placed by the code {{Advert|date=April 2023}} , and having redirects such as {{Advertisement}}, {{Advertising}}, {{Ad}} and {{Puff}}, and displaying when reading as:\nThis article contains content that is written like an advertisement . Please help improve it by removing promotional content and inappropriate external links , and by adding encyclopedic content written from a neutral point of view .\n( April 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )\nflags the issue of an article that reads like an advertisement . For example, such articles may tell users to buy a company's product, provide price lists, give links to online sellers, use unencyclopedic or meaningless buzzwords , be filled with peacock language and read like the website of the article's topic or a press release touting its virtues, rather than that of a neutrally -written encyclopedia article about the topic.\nAdvertisements are by no means limited to commercial topics and indeed are often seen for all manner of others, such as \" noble causes \", religious/spiritual leaders, sports teams, gaming clans and so forth. If the article's main problem is not advertising per se , then you can change the tag to something more appropriate, such as {{ COI }} or {{ Peacock }} or {{ POV check }}. Pages that are exclusively promotional and would need to be fundamentally rewritten to become encyclopedic may be tagged for speedy deletion under section G11 of the criteria using {{ db-g11 }} or {{ db-spam }}.\nTo address the issue, rewrite the article from a neutral point of view  – which is not just about the wording and tone, but also what the article covers and what it does not cover . Wikipedia articles should represent fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic. Removing all promotional language is a good start, but depending on what is left, may only be a surface treatment. See what you can salvage, but often editors strip out all but the most basic content, leaving it in a stub state. If you want to build a solid article, explore the existence of independent sources for the topic, and build it from the ground up.\n{{ POV }}\n{{ POV }} , typically placed by the code {{POV|date=April 2023}} , and having redirects such as {{NPOV}}, {{POV dispute}}, {{Neutrality}}, {{Neutral}} and {{Not neutral}}, and displaying when reading as:\nThe neutrality of this article is disputed .

This tag is meant to be accompanied by an explanation on the article's talk page about why it was added, identifying specific issues that are actionable within Wikipedia's content policies.\nThis template is not meant to be a permanent resident on any article.

The lead should stand on its own as a concise overview of the article's topic. A good lead section cultivates the reader's interest in reading more of the article, but not by teasing the reader or hinting at content that follows. It should identify the topic, establish context, explain why the topic is notable , and summarize the most important points, including any prominent controversies.\nTo address the issue, write a lead section. The size of an appropriate lead will depend on the breadth of the article but it should be no more than four well-composed paragraphs, and should generally not contain content that is not already present in the body of the article.\n{{ Current }}\n{{ Current }} , typically placed by the code {{Current|date=April 2023}} , and displaying when reading as:\nThis article documents a current event . Information may change rapidly as the event progresses, and initial news reports may be unreliable . The latest updates to this article may not reflect the most current information.

Wikipedia attracts numerous editors who want to update articles in real time immediately after such current events are published. However, sources for breaking news reports often contain serious inaccuracies, so these templates can also draw attention to the need to add improved sources as soon as they become available.\nThe template should generally be removed when the event described is no longer receiving massive editing attention. It is not meant to be a general disclaimer indicating that an article's contents may not be accurate, or to mark an article that merely has recent news articles about the topic (if it were, hundreds of thousands of articles would have the {{Current}} template, with no informational consequence). If the article continues to have sourcing or cleanup issues, a more appropriate maintenance template should be used instead.\n{{ Linkrot }}\n{{ Linkrot }} , typically placed by the code {{Linkrot|date=April 2023}} , and displaying when reading as:\nThis article uses bare URLs , which are uninformative and vulnerable to link rot . Please consider converting them to full citations to ensure the article remains verifiable and maintains a consistent citation style.

These bare URLs are particularly vulnerable to link rot, as the record of the reference depends on the hosting website maintaining the current site structure, which is not guaranteed. A change in the underlying URL could make the reference unusable. The full citation format, on the other hand, preserves information (such as title and author) that can be used to restore a version of the reference that is still accessible. In addition, bare URLs can be less visually pleasing if the underlying URL is long.\nTo address this issue, convert all bare URLs used as references to the appropriate citation template format . For bare URLs which are not used as references, use the following format: [bare_URL Descriptive text]. Depending on the specific URL, it may be necessary to use an archiving service to restore an URL. More information is available at Repairing a dead link .\nResearching the tagged issue\nAs noted previously, most templates contain links to guidance pages. Additionally, many templates have documentation that provides more information about the template's flagged issue, which is displayed when you visit the template page itself .\nTo access the template and thereby see its documentation, type into the search field Template: , followed by the name of the template , seen when you view its placement in the Edit interface (typically found in the first lines of the article). The first \"parameter\" is the name of the template.\nFor example, if you found this in the Edit interface, {{Unreferenced|date=April 2023}} , then you would visit the template itself by searching for Template:Unreferenced . The accompanying documentation for all maintenance templates, if it exists, can be located in this way.\nStill need help?\nIf you've read through this page and are still confused about what needs to be done to fix an issue on a page and remove a maintenance template, try asking at the Teahouse , a page designed for new users to ask questions.

The peak rises over Lhotse , while Nuptse is the ridge on the left.\nCurrently, There are at least 108 mountains on Earth with elevations of 7,200 metres (23,622 ft) or greater above sea level . The vast majority of these mountains are located on the edge of the Indian and Eurasian plates in China , India , Nepal and Pakistan .\nFigure demonstrating the concept of topographic prominence : The prominence of a peak is the height of the peak's summit above the lowest contour line encircling it and no higher summit. For example, vertical arrows show the topographic prominence of three peaks on an island. A dotted horizontal line links each peak (except the highest) to its key col .\nThe dividing line between a mountain with multiple peaks and separate mountains is not always clear (see also Highest unclimbed mountain ). A popular and intuitive way to distinguish mountains from subsidiary peaks is by their height above the highest saddle connecting it to a higher summit, a measure called topographic prominence or re-ascent (the higher summit is called the \"parent peak\"). A common definition of a mountain is a summit with 300 m (980 ft) prominence. Alternatively, a relative prominence (prominence/height) is used (usually 7–8%) to reflect that in higher mountain ranges everything is on a larger scale. The table below lists the highest 100 summits with at least 500 m (1,640 ft) prominence, approximating a 7% relative prominence. A drawback of a prominence-based list is that it may exclude well-known or spectacular mountains that are connected via a high ridge to a taller summit, such as Eiger , Nuptse or Annapurna IV . A few such peaks and mountains with nearly sufficient prominence are included in this list, and given a rank of \"S\".\nIt is very unlikely that all given heights are correct to the nearest metre; indeed, the sea level is often problematic to define when a mountain is remote from the sea. Different sources often differ by many metres, and the heights given below may well differ from those elsewhere in this encyclopedia. As an extreme example, Ulugh Muztagh on the north Tibetan Plateau is often listed as 7,723 m (25,338 ft) to 7,754 m (25,440 ft), but appears to be only 6,973 m (22,877 ft) to 6,987 m (22,923 ft). Some mountains differ by > 100 m (330 ft) on different maps, while even very thorough current measurements of Mount Everest range from 8,840 m (29,003 ft) to 8,848 m (29,029 ft). These discrepancies serve to emphasize the uncertainties in the listed heights.\nThough some parts of the world, especially the most mountainous parts, have never been thoroughly mapped, it is unlikely that any mountains this high have been overlooked, because synthetic aperture radar can and has been used to measure elevations of most otherwise inaccessible places. Still, heights or prominences may be revised, so that the order of the list may change and even new mountains could enter the list over time. To be safe, the list has been extended to include all 7,200 m (23,622 ft) peaks.\nThe highest mountains above sea level are generally not the highest above the surrounding terrain. There is no precise definition of surrounding base, but Denali , [1]\nMount Kilimanjaro [2] and Nanga Parbat [3] are possible candidates for the tallest mountain on land by this measure. The bases of mountain islands are below sea level, and given this consideration Mauna Kea (4,207 m (13,802 ft) above sea level) is the world 's tallest mountain and volcano , rising about 10,203 m (33,474 ft) from the Pacific Ocean floor. Mount Lamlam on Guam is periodically claimed to be among the world's highest mountains because it is adjacent to the Mariana Trench ; the most extreme claim is that, measured from Challenger Deep 313 kilometres (194 mi) away, Mount Lamlam is 37,820 feet (11,530 m) tall. [4] [5]\nOjos del Salado has the greatest rise on Earth : 13,420 m (44,029 ft) vertically to the summit [ citation needed ] from the bottom of the Atacama Trench , which is about 560 km (350 mi) away, although most of this rise is not part of the mountain.\nThe highest mountains are also not generally the most voluminous. Mauna Loa (4,169 m or 13,678 ft) is the largest mountain on Earth in terms of base area (about 2,000 sq mi or 5,200 km 2 ) and volume (about 10,000 cu mi or 42,000 km 3 ), although, due to the intergrade of lava from Kilauea , Hualalai and Mauna Kea , the volume can only be estimated based on surface area and height of the edifice. Mount Kilimanjaro is the largest non-shield volcano in terms of both base area (245 sq mi or 635 km 2 ) and volume (1,150 cu mi or 4,793 km 3 ). Mount Logan is the largest non-volcanic mountain in base area (120 sq mi or 311 km 2 ).\nThe highest mountains above sea level are also not those with peaks farthest from the centre of the Earth, because the figure of the Earth is not spherical. Sea level closer to the equator is several kilometres farther from the centre of the Earth. The summit of Chimborazo , Ecuador 's tallest mountain, is usually considered to be the farthest point from the Earth's centre, although the southern summit of Peru 's tallest mountain, Huascarán , is another contender. [6] Both have elevations above sea level more than 2 km (1.2 mi) less than that of Everest.\nGeographical distribution [ edit ]\nMap all coordinates using:\nOpenStreetMap  \nDownload coordinates as:\nKML\nAlmost all mountains in the list are located in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges to the south and west of the Tibetan plateau. All peaks 7,000 m (23,000 ft) or higher are located in East , Central or South Asia in a rectangle edged by Noshaq (7,492 m or 24,580 ft) on the Afghanistan–Pakistan border in the west, Jengish Chokusu (Tuōmù'ěr Fēng, 7,439 m or 24,406 ft) on the Kyrgyzstan – Xinjiang border to the north, Gongga Shan (Minya Konka, 7,556 m or 24,790 ft) in Sichuan to the east, and Kabru (7,412 m or 24,318 ft) on the Sikkim – Nepal border to the south.\nAs of December 2018 [update] , the highest peaks on four of the mountains — Gangkhar Puensum , Labuche Kang III , Karjiang , and Tongshanjiabu , all located in Bhutan or China — have not been ascended. The most recent peak to have its first ever ascent is Saser Kangri II East , in India , on 24 August 2011.\nThe highest mountain outside of Asia is Aconcagua (6,961 m or 22,838 ft), the 189th highest in the world.

They are probably quite accurate for the rarely climbed peaks (though omissions were noted), but greatly underestimate the number of ascending parties on the easier and/or more popular mountains, like most eight-thousanders . For instance, Mount Everest has been scaled 2,251 times by individuals up to 2004 .

There is no count of the peaks above 5,000 and 4,000 m. Five of the 14 highest independent peaks in the world (the eight-thousanders ) are in Pakistan (four of which lie in the surroundings of Concordia ; the confluence of Baltoro Glacier and Godwin Austen Glacier ). Most of the highest peaks in Pakistan lie in the Karakoram mountain range (which lies almost entirely in the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan, and is considered to be a separate range from Himalayan range) but some peaks above 7,000 m are included in the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges. Moreover, Pakistan is home to over 7,000 glaciers , more than anywhere except the polar regions. [1]\nConsiderations [ edit ]\nMain article: List of highest mountains\nThe list is an incomplete list of mountains in Pakistan. There are many named and unnamed peaks in Pakistan that are currently not included in this list. The list also includes many peaks that are not usually classed as independent mountains, but instead are considered sub-peaks of other mountains, due to having low topographic prominence (the height of a peak above the highest saddle connecting it to a higher summit). Also, many of the elevations listed are approximate, due to imprecise and inconsistent surveys. The ranks in the peaks above 7,000 metres (23,000 ft) are derived from the list of highest mountains .\nThe dividing line between a mountain with multiple peaks and separate mountains is not always clear (see Highest unclimbed mountain ). A common threshold is to define a mountain as a summit with 300 m prominence (1,000 ft; also 10 traditional rope lengths). Alternatively, a relative prominence (prominence or height) is used (usually 7–8%) to reflect that in higher mountain ranges everything is on a larger scale. The list of highest mountains ranks the highest 100 summits with at least 500 m prominence, approximating a 7% relative prominence. A drawback of a prominence-based list is that it may exclude peaks commonly thought of as mountains that are connected via a high ridge to a taller summit. Many such peaks and mountains with less than sufficient prominence are included but not numbered in the list.\nIt is very unlikely that all the heights given are correct to the nearest meter; indeed, problems of definition of sea level can arise when a mountain is remote from the sea. Different sources often differ by many meters, and many mountains in the Karakorum differ by over 100 metres on different maps. These discrepancies serve to emphasise the uncertainties in the listed heights.\nGeographical distribution [ edit ]\nSee also: List of mountain ranges of Pakistan\nMost of the highest mountains in Pakistan are located in the Karakoram range (the highest of which is K2 , globally ranked 2nd, 8611m), some high mountains are in Himalaya (the highest of which is Nanga Parbat , globally ranked 9th, 8126 m) and Hindu Kush (the highest of which is Tirich Mir , globally ranked 33rd, 7708 m).\nThe locations of the highest mountains are shown on the composite satellite image of Karakoram and Hindu Kush below. The numbers refer to the global ranking in this \" List of highest mountains \".

[1] Mountain ranges are formed by a variety of geological processes, but most of the significant ones on Earth are the result of plate tectonics . Mountain ranges are also found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets .\nMountain ranges are usually segmented by highlands or mountain passes and valleys . Individual mountains within the same mountain range do not necessarily have the same geologic structure or petrology . They may be a mix of different orogenic expressions and terranes , for example thrust sheets , uplifted blocks , fold mountains, and volcanic landforms resulting in a variety of rock types .\nMajor ranges [ edit ]\nThe Ocean Ridge , the world's longest mountain range (chain)\nMost geologically young mountain ranges on the Earth's land surface are associated with either the Pacific Ring of Fire or the Alpide belt . The Pacific Ring of Fire includes the Andes of South America, extends through the North American Cordillera , the Aleutian Range , on through Kamchatka Peninsula , Japan , Taiwan , the Philippines , Papua New Guinea , to New Zealand . [2] The Andes is 7,000 kilometres (4,350 mi) long and is often considered the world's longest mountain system. [3]\nThe Alpide belt stretches 15,000 km across southern Eurasia , from Java in Maritime Southeast Asia to the Iberian Peninsula in Western Europe , including the ranges of the Himalayas , Karakoram , Hindu Kush , Alborz , Caucasus , and the Alps . [4] The Himalayas contain the highest mountains in the world, including Mount Everest , which is 8,848 metres (29,029 ft) high. [5]\nMountain ranges outside these two systems include the Arctic Cordillera , Appalachians , Great Dividing Range , East Siberians , Altais , Scandinavians , Qinling , Western Ghats , Vindhyas , Byrrangas , and the Annamite Range . If the definition of a mountain range is stretched to include underwater mountains, then the Ocean Ridge forms the longest continuous mountain system on Earth, with a length of 65,000 kilometres (40,400 mi). [6]\nClimate [ edit ]\nThe Andes , the world's longest mountain range on the surface of the Earth, have a dramatic impact on the climate of South America\nThe position of mountain ranges influences climate, such as rain or snow. When air masses move up and over mountains, the air cools, producing orographic precipitation (rain or snow). As the air descends on the leeward side, it warms again (following the adiabatic lapse rate ) and is drier, having been stripped of much of its moisture. Often, a rain shadow will affect the leeward side of a range. [7] As a consequence, large mountain ranges, such as the Andes, compartmentalize continents into distinct climate regions .\nErosion [ edit ]\nMountain ranges are constantly subjected to erosional forces which work to tear them down. The basins adjacent to an eroding mountain range are then filled with sediments that are buried and turned into sedimentary rock . Erosion is at work while the mountains are being uplifted until the mountains are reduced to low hills and plains.\nThe early Cenozoic uplift of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado provides an example. As the uplift was occurring some 10,000 feet (3,000 m) of mostly Mesozoic sedimentary strata were removed by erosion over the core of the mountain range and spread as sand and clays across the Great Plains to the east. [8] This mass of rock was removed as the range was actively undergoing uplift. The removal of such a mass from the core of the range most likely caused further uplift as the region adjusted isostatically in response to the removed weight.\nRivers are traditionally believed to be the principal cause of mountain range erosion, by cutting into bedrock and transporting sediment. Computer simulation has shown that as mountain belts change from tectonically active to inactive, the rate of erosion drops because there are fewer abrasive particles in the water and fewer landslides. [9]\nExtraterrestrial \"Montes\" [ edit ]\nFurther information: List of tallest mountains in the Solar System\nMontes Apenninus on the Moon was formed by an impact event.\nMountains on other planets and natural satellites of the Solar System, including the Moon , are often isolated and formed mainly by processes such as impacts, though there are examples of mountain ranges (or \"Montes\") somewhat similar to those on Earth. Saturn 's moon Titan [10] and Pluto , [11] in particular, exhibit large mountain ranges in chains composed mainly of ices rather than rock. Examples include the Mithrim Montes and Doom Mons on Titan, and Tenzing Montes and Hillary Montes on Pluto. Some terrestrial planets other than Earth also exhibit rocky mountain ranges, such as Maxwell Montes on Venus taller than any on Earth [12] and Tartarus Montes on Mars . [13] Jupiter's moon Io has mountain ranges formed from tectonic processes including the Boösaule , Dorian, Hi'iaka and Euboea Montes' .

It is mainly situated in the Himalayas , but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain , bordering the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north , and India in the south, east, and west , while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor , and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim . Nepal has a diverse geography , including fertile plains , subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains , including Mount Everest , the highest point on Earth. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city .\nThe name \"Nepal\" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent , the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha , the founder of Buddhism , was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet . The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans , and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala . The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley's traders . The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture . By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal . The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire , under its Rana dynasty of premiers . The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India . Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular\nrepublic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy.\nThe Constitution of Nepal , adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a secular\nfederal parliamentary republic divided into seven provinces . Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship treaties were signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative . The Nepalese Armed Forces are the fifth-largest in South Asia; and are notable for their Gurkha history, particularly during the world wars , and has been a significant contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations.\nEtymology\nMain article: Name of Nepal\n\"Nēpāla\" in the late Brahmi script , in the Allahabad Pillar inscription of Samudragupta (350–375 CE). [15]\nBefore the unification of Nepal , the Kathmandu Valley was known as Nepal . [a] The precise origin of the term Nepāl is uncertain. Nepal appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the fourth century BC. [ which? ] An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest texts may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period . Academic attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages. [17]\nAccording to Hindu mythology , Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called Ne , referred to variously as Ne Muni or Nemi . According to Pashupati Purāna , as a place protected by Ne , the country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as Nepāl . [b] According to Nepāl Mahātmya , [c]\nNemi was charged with protection of the country by Pashupati . [18] According to Buddhist mythology , Manjushri\nBodhisattva drained a primordial lake of serpents to create the Nepal valley and proclaimed that Adi-Buddha\nNe would take care of the community that would settle it. As the cherished of Ne , the valley would be called Nepāl . [19] According to Gopalarājvamshāvali , the genealogy of ancient Gopala dynasty compiled c.  1380s , Nepal is named after Nepa the cowherd, the founder of the Nepali scion of the Abhiras . In this account, the cow that issued milk to the spot, at which Nepa discovered the Jyotirlinga of Pashupatināth upon investigation, was also named Ne . [17]\nNorwegian indologist\nChristian Lassen had proposed that Nepāla was a compound of Nipa (foot of a mountain) and -ala (short suffix for alaya meaning abode), and so Nepāla meant \"abode at the foot of the mountain\". He considered Ne Muni to be a fabrication. [20] Indologist Sylvain Levi found Lassen's theory untenable but had no theories of his own, only suggesting that either Newara is a vulgarism of sanskritic\nNepala, or Nepala is Sanskritisation of the local ethnic; [21] his view has found some support though it does not answer the question of etymology. [22] [23] [24] [17] It has also been proposed that Nepa is a Tibeto-Burman stem consisting of Ne (cattle) and Pa (keeper), reflecting the fact that early inhabitants of the valley were Gopalas (cowherds) and Mahispalas (buffalo-herds). [17]\nSuniti Kumar Chatterji believed Nepal originated from Tibeto-Burman roots – Ne, of uncertain meaning (as multiple possibilities exist), and pala or bal , whose meaning is lost entirely. [25]\nHistory\nMain article: History of Nepal\nAncient Nepal\nAncient Nepal\nThis painting in a Laotian temple depicts a legend surrounding the birth of Gautama Buddha\nc.  563 BC in Lumbini , Western Nepal.\nIn the premises of the Changu Narayan Temple , is a stone inscription dated 464 AD, the first in Nepal since the Ashoka inscription of Lumbini ( c.  250 BC).\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved. [26] [27] [28] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago. [29] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time. [30]\nAfter 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan . [31] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley civilisation , [32] [31] the first urban culture in South Asia. [33] Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic , mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang district . [34] The earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley civilisation . It is possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border. [35] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or both. [36]\nStella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians, who were in Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the valley of Kathmandu. [37]\nBy the late Vedic period , Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu texts, such as the late Vedic Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa and in the post-Vedic Atharvashirsha\nUpanishad . [38] The Gopal Bansa was the oldest dynasty to be mentioned in various texts as the earliest rulers of the central Himalayan kingdom known by the name 'Nepal'. [39] The Gopalas were followed by Kiratas who ruled for over 16 centuries by some accounts. [40] According to the Mahabharata , the then Kirata king went to take part in the Battle of Kurukshetra . In the south-eastern region, Janakpurdham was the capital of the prosperous kingdom of Videha or Mithila, that extended down to the Ganges, and home to King Janaka and his daughter, Sita .\nAround 600 BC, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of Nepal. From one of these, the Shakya polity, arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life, founded Buddhism , and came to be known as Gautama Buddha (traditionally dated 563–483 BC). [41] Nepal came to be established as a land of spirituality and refuge in the intervening centuries, played an important role in transmitting Buddhism to East Asia via Tibet, [42] and helped preserve Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts.\nBy 250 BC, the southern regions had come under the influence of the Maurya Empire . Emperor Ashoka made a pilgrimage to Lumbini and erected a pillar at Buddha's birthplace, the inscriptions on which mark the starting point for properly recorded history of Nepal. [43] Ashoka also visited the Kathmandu valley and built monuments commemorating Gautama Buddha's visit there. By the 4th century AD, much of Nepal was under the influence of the Gupta Empire . [d] [44]\nIn the Kathmandu valley, the Kiratas were pushed eastward by the Licchavis , and the Licchavi dynasty came into power c. 400 AD. The Lichchhavis built monuments and left a series of inscriptions; Nepal's history of the period is pieced together almost entirely from them. [45] [42] In 641, Songtsen Gampo of the Tibetan Empire sends Narendradeva back to Licchavi with an army and subjugates Nepal. Parts of Nepal and Licchavi was later under the direct influences of the Tibetan empire. [46] The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late 8th century and was followed by a Thakuri rule. Thakuri kings ruled over the country up to the middle of the 11th century AD; not much is known of this period that is often called the dark period. [47]\nMedieval Nepal\nMedieval Nepal\nSinja Valley , thought to be the place of origin of the Khasas and the Nepali language , was at the heart of the Khas Malla empire.\nPatan Durbar Square , one of the three palace squares in the Kathmandu Valley, was built by the Mallas in the 17th century. The Durbar Squares are a culmination of over a millennium of development in Nepali art and architecture.\nIn the 11th century, a powerful empire of Khas people emerged in western Nepal whose territory at its highest peak included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western Tibet and Uttarakhand of India. By the 14th century, the empire had splintered into loosely associated Baise rajyas , literally 22 states as they were counted. The rich culture and language of the Khas people spread throughout Nepal and as far as Indo-China in the intervening centuries; their language , later renamed the Nepali language, became the lingua franca of Nepal as well as much of North-east India. [42]\nIn south-eastern Nepal, Simraungarh annexed Mithila around 1100 AD, and the unified Tirhut stood as a powerful kingdom for more than 200 years, [48] even ruling over Kathmandu for a time. [49] After another 300 years of Muslim rule, Tirhut came under the control of the Sens of Makawanpur . [48] In the eastern hills, a confederation of Kirat principalities ruled the area between Kathmandu and Bengal.\nIn the Kathmandu valley, the Mallas , who make several appearances in Nepalese history since ancient times, had established themselves in Kathmandu and Patan by the middle of the 14th century. The Mallas ruled the valley first under the suzerainty of Tirhut but established independent reign by late 14th century as Tirhut went into decline. In the late 14th century, Jayasthiti Malla introduced widespread socio-economic reforms, principal of which was the caste system. By dividing the indigenous non-Aryan Buddhist population into castes modelled after the four Varna system of Hinduism, he provided an influential model for the Sanskritisation and Hinduisation of the indigenous non-Hindu tribal populations in all principalities throughout Nepal. By the middle of the 15th century, Kathmandu had become a powerful empire which, according to Kirkpatrick , extended from Digarchi or Sigatse in Tibet to Tirhut and Gaya in India. [50] In the late 15th century, Malla princes divided their kingdom in four – Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur in the valley and Banepa to the east. The competition for prestige among these brotherly kingdoms saw the flourishing of art and architecture in central Nepal, and the building of famous Kathmandu , Patan and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares ; their division and mistrust led to their fall in the late 18th century, and ultimately, the unification of Nepal into a modern state. [42] [51]\nApart from one destructive sacking of Kathmandu valley in the mid 14th century, [52] Nepal remains largely untouched by the Muslim invasion of India that began in the 11th century. The Mughal period saw an influx of high-caste Hindus from India into Nepal. They soon intermingled with the Khas people and by the 16th century, there were about 50 Rajput-ruled principalities in Nepal, including the 22 (Baisi) states and, to their east in west-central Nepal, 24 Chaubisi states . There emerged a view that Nepal remained the true bastion of unadulterated Hinduism at a time when Indian culture had been influenced by centuries of Mughal, followed by British rule . Gorkha , one of the Baisi states, emerged as an influential and ambitious kingdom with a reputation for justice, after it codified the first Hinduism-based laws in the Nepalese hills. [42]\nUnification, expansion and consolidation (1768–1951)\nMain article: Kingdom of Nepal\nPrithvi Narayan Shah , began the unification process of what would become the present-day country of Nepal\nDuring Bhimsen Thapa 's premiership Nepal reached its zenith\nJung Bahadur Rana , who established the autocratic Rana regime in 1846 and instituted a pro-British foreign policy\nDuring King Mahendra 's reign, Nepal experienced a period of industrial, political, and economic change.\nIn the mid-18th century, Prithvi Narayan Shah , a Gorkha king, set out to put together what would become present-day Nepal. He embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms. After several bloody battles and sieges, notably the Battle of Kirtipur , he managed to conquer the Kathmandu Valley in 1769. [53] The Gorkha control reached its height when the Kumaon and Garhwal Kingdoms in the west to Sikkim in the east came under Nepalese control. A dispute with Tibet over the control of mountain passes and inner Tingri valleys of Tibet prompted the Qing Emperor of China to start the Sino-Nepali War compelling the Nepali to retreat to their own borders in the north. [54] The rivalry between the Kingdom of Nepal and the East India Company over the control of states bordering Nepal eventually led to the Anglo-Nepali War (1815–16). At first, the British underestimated the Nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing. Thus began the reputation of Gurkhas as fierce and ruthless soldiers. The war ended in the Sugauli Treaty , under which Nepal ceded recently captured lands. [55] [42]\nFactionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability. In 1846, a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow Jung Bahadur Kunwar, a fast-rising military leader. This led to the Kot massacre ; armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country. Bir Narsingh Kunwar emerged victoriously and founded the Rana dynasty , and came to be known as Jung Bahadur Rana . The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Ranas were staunchly pro-British and assisted them during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (and later in both World Wars). In 1860 some parts of the western Terai region were gifted to Nepal by the British as a friendly gesture because of her military help to sustain British control in India during the rebellion (known as Naya Muluk , new country). In 1923, the United Kingdom and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship that superseded the Sugauli Treaty of 1816. [56]\nThe Hindu practice of Sati , in which a widow sacrificed herself in the funeral pyre of her husband, was banned in 1919, and slavery was officially abolished in 1924. [57] Rana rule was marked by tyranny, debauchery , economic exploitation and religious persecution. [58] [59]\nContemporary history\nIn the late 1940s, newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were critical of the Rana autocracy. Following the success of Indian Independence Movement which Nepalese activists had taken part in, with India's support and cooperation of King Tribhuvan, Nepali Congress was successful in toppling the Rana regime, establishing a parliamentary democracy. After a decade of power wrangling between the king and the government, King Mahendra (ruled 1955–1972) scrapped the democratic experiment in 1960, and a \"partyless\" Panchayat system was made to govern Nepal. The political parties were banned and politicians imprisoned or exiled. [60] The Panchayat rule modernised the country, introducing reforms and developing infrastructure, but curtailed liberties and imposed heavy censorship. In 1990, the People's Movement forced King Birendra (ruled 1972–2001) to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty democracy. [60] [61]\nIn 1996, the Maoist Party started a violent bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a people's republic. [60] This led to the long Nepali Civil War and more than 16,000 deaths. [62] With the death of both the King and the Crown Prince in a massacre in the royal palace , King Birendra's brother Gyanendra inherited the throne in 2001 [60] and subsequently assumed full executive powers aiming to quash the Maoist insurgency himself. [63]\nThe Maoist Party joined mainstream politics following the success of the peaceful democratic revolution of 2006 ; [64] Nepal became a secular state , [65] and on 28 May 2008, it was declared a federal republic, [64] ending its time-honoured status as the world's only Hindu kingdom. [66] After a decade of instability and internal strife which saw two constituent assembly elections, [67] [68] [69] [70] the new constitution was promulgated on 20 September 2015, making Nepal a federal democratic republic divided into seven provinces . [71] [72]\nGeography\nMain articles: Geography of Nepal and Geology of Nepal\nA topographic map of Nepal\nNepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about 800 kilometres (500 mi) long and 200 kilometres (120 mi) wide, with an area of 147,516 km 2 (56,956 sq mi). It lies between latitudes 26° and 31°N , and longitudes 80° and 89°E . Nepal's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana , began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east. [73] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn\noceanic crust , to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian plate . [73] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle , both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas . [73] The rising barriers blocked the paths of rivers creating large lakes, which only broke through as late as 100,000 years ago, creating fertile valleys in the middle hills like the Kathmandu Valley. In the western region, rivers which were too strong to be hampered, cut some of the world's deepest gorges. [74] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment [75] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain . [76] Nepal lies almost completely within this collision zone, occupying the central sector of the Himalayan arc, nearly one-third of the 2,400 km (1,500 mi)-long Himalayas, [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] with a small strip of southernmost Nepal stretching into the Indo-Gangetic plain and two districts in the northwest stretching up to the Tibetan plateau. [74]\nMount Everest , the highest peak on earth, lies on the Nepal–China border.\nNepal is divided into three principal physiographic belts known as Himal – Pahad – Terai . [e] Himal is the mountain region containing snow and situated in the Great Himalayan Range; it makes up the northern part of Nepal. It contains the highest elevations in the world including 8,848.86 metres (29,032 ft) height Mount Everest ( Sagarmāthā in Nepali) on the border with China. Seven other of the world's \" eight-thousanders \" are in Nepal or on its border with Tibet: Lhotse , Makalu , Cho Oyu , Kangchenjunga , Dhaulagiri , Annapurna and Manaslu . Pahad is the mountain region that does not generally contain snow. The mountains vary from 800 to 4,000 metres (2,600 to 13,100 ft) in altitude, with progression from subtropical climates below 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) to alpine climates above 3,600 metres (11,800 ft). The Lower Himalayan Range , reaching 1,500 to 3,000 metres (4,900 to 9,800 ft), is the southern limit of this region, with subtropical river valleys and \"hills\" alternating to the north of this range. Population density is high in valleys but notably less above 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) and very low above 2,500 metres (8,200 ft), where snow occasionally falls in winter. The southern lowland plains or Terai bordering India are part of the northern rim of the Indo-Gangetic Plain . Terai is the lowland region containing some hill ranges. The plains were formed and are fed by three major Himalayan rivers: the Koshi , the Narayani , and the Karnali as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline. This region has a subtropical to tropical climate. The outermost range of the foothills called Sivalik Hills or Churia Range, cresting at 700 to 1,000 metres (2,300 to 3,280 ft), marks the limits of the Gangetic Plain. Broad, low valleys called Inner Terai Valleys ( Bhitri Tarai Upatyaka ) lie north of these foothills in several places.\nKöppen climate classification for Nepal\nThe Indian plate continues to move north relative to Asia at about 50 mm (2.0 in) per year. [83] This makes Nepal an earthquake-prone zone, and periodic earthquakes that have devastating consequences present a significant hurdle to development. [84] Erosion of the Himalayas is a very important source of sediment, which flows to the Indian Ocean. [85] Saptakoshi, in particular, carries a huge amount of silt out of Nepal but sees extreme drop in Gradient in Bihar , causing severe floods and course changes, and is, therefore, known as the sorrow of Bihar. Severe flooding and landslides cause deaths and disease, destroy farmlands and cripple the transport infrastructure of the country, during the monsoon season each year.\nNepal has five climatic zones, broadly corresponding to the altitudes. The tropical and subtropical zones lie below 1,200 metres (3,900 ft), the temperate zone 1,200 to 2,400 metres (3,900 to 7,900 ft), the cold zone 2,400 to 3,600 metres (7,900 to 11,800 ft), the subarctic zone 3,600 to 4,400 metres (11,800 to 14,400 ft), and the Arctic zone above 4,400 metres (14,400 ft). Nepal experiences five seasons: summer, monsoon , autumn, winter and spring. The Himalayas block cold winds from Central Asia in the winter and form the northern limits of the monsoon wind patterns.\nBiodiversity\nMain article: Wildlife of Nepal\nSee also: List of protected areas of Nepal and Community forestry in Nepal\nThis land cover map of Nepal using Landsat 30 m (2010) data shows forest cover as the dominant type of land cover in Nepal. [86]\nNepal contains a disproportionately large diversity of plants and animals, relative to its size. [87] [88] Nepal, in its entirety, forms the western portion of the eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, with notable biocultural diversity . [89] The dramatic differences in elevation found in Nepal (60 m from sea level in the Terai plains, to 8,848 m Mount Everest ) [90] result in a variety of biomes . [87] The Eastern half of Nepal is richer in biodiversity as it receives more rain, compared to western parts, where arctic desert -type conditions are more common at higher elevations. [88] Nepal is a habitat for 4.0% of all mammal species , 8.9% of bird species , 1.0% of reptile species , 2.5% of amphibian species , 1.9% of fish species , 3.7% of butterfly species , 0.5% of moth species and 0.4% of spider species . [88] In its 35 forest-types and 118 ecosystems, [87] [f] Nepal harbours 2% of the flowering plant species , 3% of pteridophytes and 6% of bryophytes . [88]\nThe greater one-horned rhinoceros roams the sub-tropical grasslands of the Terai plains.\nNepal's forest cover is 59,624 km 2 (23,021 sq mi), 40.36% of the country's total land area, with an additional 4.38% of scrubland , for a total forested area of 44.74%, an increase of 5% since the turn of the millennium. [91] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.23/10, ranking it 45th globally out of 172 countries. [92] In the southern plains, Terai–Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion contains some of the world's tallest grasses as well as Sal forests, tropical evergreen forests and tropical riverine deciduous forests. [93] In the lower hills (700 m – 2,000 m), subtropical and temperate deciduous mixed forests containing mostly S al (in the lower altitudes), Chilaune and Katus , as well as subtropical pine forest dominated by chir pine are common. The middle hills (2,000 m – 3,000 m) are dominated by oak and rhododendron . Subalpine coniferous forests cover the 3,000 m to 3,500 m range, dominated by oak (particularly in the west), Eastern Himalayan fir , Himalayan pine and Himalayan hemlock ; rhododendron is common as well. Above 3,500 m in the west and 4,000 m in the east, coniferous trees give way to rhododendron-dominated alpine shrubs and meadows . [88]\nAmong the notable trees, are the astringent\nAzadirachta indica , or neem , which is widely used in traditional herbal medicine , [94] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa , or peepal , [95] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro , [96] and under which Gautam Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment. [97]\nThe Himalayan monal ( Danphe ), the national bird of Nepal, [98] nests high in the Himalayas.\nMost of the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest of the lower Himalayan region is descended from the Tethyan\nTertiary flora. [99] As the Indian Plate collided with Eurasia forming and raising the Himalayas, the arid and semi-arid Mediterranean flora was pushed up and adapted to the more alpine climate over the next 40–50 million years. [99] [100] The Himalayan biodiversity hotspot was the site of mass exchange and intermingling of the Indian and Eurasian species in the neogene . [101] One mammal species ( Himalayan field mouse ), two each of bird and reptile species, nine amphibia, eight fish and 29 butterfly species are endemic to Nepal. [88] [g]\nNepal contains 107 IUCN -designated threatened species , 88 of them animal species, 18 plant species and one species of \"fungi or protist\" group. [103] These include the endangered\nBengal tiger , the red panda , the Asiatic elephant , the Himalayan musk deer , the wild water buffalo and the South Asian river dolphin , [104] as well as the critically endangered\ngharial , the Bengal florican , [87] [105] and the white-rumped vulture , which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac -treated cattle. [106] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Nepali wildlife . In response, the system of national parks and protected areas , first established in 1973 with the enactment of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1973 , [107] was substantially expanded. Vulture restaurants [88] coupled with a ban on veterinary usage of diclofenac has seen a rise in the number of white-rumped vultures. [108] [106] The community forestry programme which has seen a third of the country's population directly participate in managing a quarter of the total forested area has helped the local economies while reducing human-wildlife conflict . [109] [110] The breeding programmes [111] coupled with community-assisted military patrols, [112] and a crackdown on poaching and smuggling, has seen poaching of critically endangered tigers and elephants as well as vulnerable rhinos, among others, go down to effectively zero, and their numbers have steadily increased. [113] Nepal has ten national parks , three wildlife reserves , one hunting reserve , three Conservation Areas and eleven buffer zones , covering a total area of 28,959.67 km 2 (11,181.39 sq mi), or 19.67% of the total land area, [114] while ten wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention . [115]\nPolitics and government\nPolitics\nRam Chandra Poudel President\nPushpa Kamal Dahal Prime Minister\nMain article: Politics of Nepal\nNepal is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system. [116] Nepal used to be referred as 'Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal' until Nepal Government decided to use just 'Nepal' as official name of the country. [117] It has seven national political parties recognised in the federal parliament: Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) , Nepali Congress , Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) , Rastriya Swatantra Party , Rastriya Prajatantra Party , People's Socialist Party and Janamat Party . [118] [116] Of the two major parties which both officially espouse democratic socialism, CPN(UML) is considered leftist while Nepali Congress is considered centrist. [119] During most of the brief periods of democratic exercise in the 1950s and the 1990s, Nepali Congress held majority of seats in parliament; CPN (UML) was its competitor in the 1990s. [120] After the Maoists entered the political process in 2006, they emerged as the third largest party. [67] In the aftermath of the 2017 elections , the first one according to the new constitution, NCP, formed by the merger of CPN (UML) and CPN (Maoist Centre) had become the ruling party at the federal level and in six out of seven provinces. [121] After the 2022 general election , the House of Representatives of 2nd Federal parliament was formed as hung parliament and a coalition government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal was formed in December 2022.\nB.P. Koirala led the 1951 revolution, became the first democratically elected Prime Minister, and after being deposed and imprisoned in 1961, spent the rest of his life fighting for democracy.\nIn the 1930s, a vibrant underground political movement arose in the capital, birthing Nepal Praja Parishad in 1936, [60] which was dissolved seven years later, following the execution of the four great martyrs . Around the same time, Nepalis involved in the Indian independence movement started organizing into political parties, leading to the birth of Nepali Congress and Communist Party of Nepal . [122] As communism was trying to find its footing, Nepali Congress was successful in overthrowing the Rana regime in 1951 and enjoyed the overwhelming support of the electorate. [123] In the partyless Panchayat system initiated in 1962 by King Mahendra , monarchy loyalists took turns leading the government; political leaders remained underground, exiled or in prison. [60] A communist insurgency was crushed in its cradle in the 1970s, which led to the eventual coalescence of hitherto scattered communist factions under the United Left Front .\nAfter the joint civil resistance launched by the United Left Front and Nepali Congress overthrew the Panchayat in 1990, [123] [124] the Front became CPN (UML) , adopted multi-party democracy, and in the brief period, it was in government, introduced welfare programmes that remain popular. [120] After the Maoist Party joined mainstream politics, in the aftermath of the peaceful revolution of 2006 , it also adopted multi-party democracy as its official line. The transition period between 2006 and 2015 saw sustained protests from the newly formed ethnocentric nationalist movements, principal among them the Madhes Movement .\nGovernment\nMain articles: Government of Nepal and Constitution of Nepal\nNepal is governed according to the Constitution of Nepal . It defines Nepal as having multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious, multi-cultural characteristics with common aspirations of people living in diverse geographical regions, and being committed to and united by a bond of allegiance to the national independence, territorial integrity, national interest, and prosperity of Nepal. [3]\nSingha Durbar , the seat of government in Kathmandu\nThe Supreme Court\nParliament House\nThe Government of Nepal has three branches: [3]\nExecutive : The form of governance is a multi-party, competitive, federal democratic republican parliamentary system based on plurality. The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister, who forms the Council of ministers that exercises the executive power.\nLegislature : The Legislature of Nepal, called the Federal Parliament, consists of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly. The House of Representatives consists of 275 members elected through a mixed electoral system and has a term of five years. The National Assembly, consisting of 59 members elected by provincial electoral colleges, is a permanent house; a third of its members are elected every two years for a six-year term. [125]\nJudiciary : Nepal has a unitary three-tier independent judiciary that comprises the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, headed by the Chief Justice , seven High Courts, one in each province, the highest court at the provincial level, and 77 district courts, one in each district. The municipal councils can convene local judicial bodies to resolve disputes and render non-binding verdicts in cases not involving actionable crime. The actions and proceedings of the local judicial bodies may be guided and countermanded by the district courts.

Each province is composed of 8 to 14 districts. The districts, in turn, comprise local units known as urban and rural municipalities. [3] There is a total of 753 local units which includes 6 metropolitan municipalities, 11 sub-metropolitan municipalities and 276 municipalities for a total of 293 urban municipalities, and 460 rural municipalities. [126] Each local unit is composed of wards. There are 6,743 wards in total.\nThe local governments enjoy executive and legislative as well as limited judicial powers in their local jurisdiction. The provinces have unicameral parliamentary Westminster system of governance. The local and provincial governments exercise some absolute powers and some powers shared with provincial or federal government. The district coordination committee, a committee composed of all elected officials from the local governments in the district, has a very limited role. [3] [126]\nLaws and law enforcement\nMain article: Law enforcement in Nepal\nNepal has made progress with regard to minority rights in recent years.\nThe Constitution of Nepal is the supreme law of the land, and any other laws contradicting it are automatically invalid to the extent of the contradiction. [127] The specific legal provisions are codified as Civil Code and Criminal Code, accompanied by Civil Procedure Code and Criminal Procedure Code respectively. [128] The Supreme Court is the highest authority in the interpretation of laws and it can direct the parliament to amend or enact new laws as required. Nepali laws are considered generally more progressive compared to other developing countries, and in some instances, many developed ones. The death penalty has been abolished. [129] Nepal also has made progress in LGBT rights and gender equality . It recognises marital rape and supports abortion rights. Owing to a rise in sex-selective abortion, however, constraints have been introduced. Nepal is a signatory to the Geneva Convention , Conventions/Treaties on the prohibition of Biological , Chemical and Nuclear weapons , [130]\nInternational Labour Organization Fundamental Conventions , Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Paris climate accord . Some legal provisions, guided by socio-economic, cultural and religious sensibilities, remain discriminatory. There is gender-based discrimination against foreign nationals married to Nepali citizens. [h] Paternal lineage of a person is valued and required in legal documents. Many laws remain unenforced in practice.\nTraffic Police personnel manually direct traffic at the busiest roads and junctions.\nNepal Police is the primary law enforcement agency. It is an independent organisation under the command of the Inspector General , who is appointed by and reports to the Ministry of Home Affairs . In addition to maintaining law and order, it is responsible for the management of road traffic, which is undertaken by Nepal Traffic Police. Nepal Armed Police Force , a separate paramilitary police organisation, works in cooperation with Nepal police in routine security matters; it is intended for crowd control, counter-insurgency and anti-terrorism actions, and other internal matters where the use of force may be necessary. The Crime Investigation Department of Nepal Police specialises in criminal investigation and forensic analysis. [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority is an independent investigative agency that investigates and prosecutes cases related to corruption, bribery and abuses of authority. At 2.16 per 100,000 in 2016, Nepal's intentional homicide rate is much lower than average; police data indicates a steady increase in the crime rate in recent years. [137] Nepal was ranked 76 out of 163 countries in the Global Peace Index (GPI) in 2019. [138]\nForeign relations\nMain article: Foreign relations of Nepal\nGurkha Memorial, London\nNepal depends on diplomacy for national defence. It maintains a policy of neutrality between its neighbours, has amicable relations with other countries in the region, and has a policy of non-alignment at the global stage. Nepal is a member of SAARC , UN , WTO , BIMSTEC and ACD , among others. It has bilateral diplomatic relations with 167 countries and the EU, [139] has embassies in 30 countries [140] and six consulates, [141] while 25 countries maintain embassies in Nepal, and more than 80 others maintain non-residential diplomatic missions. [142] Nepal is one of the major contributors to the UN peacekeeping missions, having contributed more than 119,000 personnel to 42 missions since 1958. [143] Nepali people have a reputation for honesty, loyalty and bravery, which has led to them serving as legendary Gurkha warriors in the Indian and British armies for the last 200 years, with service in both world wars, India-Pakistan wars as well as Afghanistan and Iraq, [144] though Nepal was not directly involved in any of those conflicts, and winning the highest military awards, including the Victoria Cross and the Param Vir Chakra . [145]\nNepal is one of the major contributors to UN peacekeeping missions.\nNepal pursues a policy of \"balanced relations\" with the two giant immediate neighbours, India and China; [146] [147] the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship with India provides for a much closer relationship. [148] Nepal and India share an open border with free movement of people, religious, cultural and marital ties. India is Nepal's largest trading partner, which it depends upon for all of its oil and gas, and a number of essential goods. Nepalis can own property in India, while Indians are free to live and work in Nepal. [149] Relations between India and Nepal, though very close, have faced difficulties stemming from territorial disputes , [150] economics, and the problems inherent in big power-small power relations. [151] [ failed verification ] Nepal established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on 1 August 1955, and signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1960; relations since have been based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence . Nepal maintains neutrality in conflicts between China and India. It remains firmly committed to the One China Policy and is known to curb anti-China activities from the Tibetan refugees in Nepal. [152] [153] Citizens of both countries can cross the border and travel as far as 30 km without a visa. [154] China is viewed favourably in Nepal owing to the absence of any border disputes or serious interference in internal politics, coupled with its assistance in infrastructure development and aid during emergencies; favourability has increased since China helped Nepal during the 2015 economic blockade imposed by India. [155] Subsequently, China granted Nepal access to its ports for third-country trade, and Nepal joined China's Belt and Road Initiative . [156]\nNepal emphasises greater cooperation in South Asia and actively pushed for the establishment of SAARC , the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the permanent secretariat of which, is hosted in Kathmandu. [157] Nepal was one of the first countries to recognise an independent Bangladesh, and the two countries seek to enhance greater cooperation, on trade and water management; seaports in Bangladesh, being closer, are seen as viable alternatives to India's monopoly on Nepal's third-country trade. [158] Nepal was the first South Asian country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, and the countries enjoy a strong relationship; [159] it recognises the rights of the Palestinians, having voted in favour of its recognition at the UN and against the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. [160] Countries that Nepal maintains a close relationship with, include the most generous donors and development partners—the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Japan and Norway, among others. [161]\nMilitary and intelligence\nMain article: Nepali Army\nThe multipurpose Kukri knife (top) is the signature weapon of the Nepali armed forces, and is used by the Gurkhas, Nepal Army, Police and even security guards.\nThe President is the supreme commander of the Nepali Army ; its routine management is handled by the Ministry of Defence . The military expenditure for 2018 was $398.5 million, [162] around 1.4% of GDP. [163] An almost exclusively ground infantry force, Nepal Army numbers at less than one hundred thousand; [164] [165] [166] recruitment is voluntary. [167] It has few aircraft, mainly helicopters, primarily used for transport, patrol, and search and rescue. [168]\nDirectorate of Military Intelligence under Nepal Army serves as the military intelligence agency; [169]\nNational Investigation Department tasked with national and international intelligence gathering, is independent. [164] Nepal Army is primarily used for routine security of critical assets, an anti-poaching patrol of national parks, counterinsurgency, and search and rescue during natural disasters; [170] it also undertakes major construction projects. [171] There are no discriminatory policies on recruitment into the army, but it is dominated by men from elite Pahari warrior castes. [172] [173]\nEconomy\nMain article: Economy of Nepal\nA proportional representation of Nepal exports, 2019\nNepal is a developing country , which ranks 165th in the world [i] in nominal GDP per capita [174] and 162nd [j] in GDP per capita at PPP . [175] Nepal's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2019 was $34.186 billion. [176] [177] With an annual growth rate calculated at 6.6% in 2019, [178] and expected 2.89% in 2021, [179] Nepal is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. [ citation needed ] Nepal has been a member of WTO since 23 April 2004. [180]\nThe 16.8-million-worker Nepali labour force is the 37th largest in the world. [181]\nThe primary sector makes up 27.59% of GDP, the secondary sector 14.6%, and the tertiary sector 57.81%. [182] Nepal's foreign exchange remittances of US$8.1 billion in 2018, the 19th largest in the world and constituting 28.0% of GDP, [183] were contributed to its economy by millions of workers primarily in India, the Middle East and East Asia, almost all of them unskilled labourers. [184] [185] Major agricultural products include cereals (barley, maize, millet, paddy and wheat), oilseed, potato, pulses, sugarcane, jute, tobacco, milk and water buffalo meat. [186] [187] Major industries include tourism, carpets, textiles, cigarettes, cement, brick, as well as small rice, jute, sugar and oilseed mills. [186] Nepal's international trade greatly expanded in 1951 with the establishment of democracy; liberalisation began in 1985 and picked up pace after 1990. By the fiscal year 2016/17, Nepal's foreign trade amounted Rs 1.06 trillion, a twenty-three folds increase from Rs 45.6 billion in 1990/91. More than 60% of Nepal's trade is with India. Major exports include readymade garment, carpet, pulses, handicrafts, leather, medicinal herbs, and paper products, which account for 90% of the total. Major imports include various finished and semi-finished goods, raw materials, machinery and equipment, chemical fertilisers, electrical and electronic devices, petroleum products, gold, and readymade garments. [188] Inflation was at 4.5% in 2019. [189] Foreign exchange reserves were at US$9.5 billion in July 2019, equivalent to 7.8 months of imports. [189]\nReal GDP per capita development of Nepal\nNepal has made significant progress in poverty reduction bringing the population below the international poverty line (US$1.90 per person per day) from 15% in 2010 to just 9.3% in 2018, although vulnerability remains extremely high, with almost 32% of the population living on between US$1.90 and US$3.20 per person per day. [189] Nepal has made improvement in sectors like nutrition, child mortality, electricity, improved flooring and assets. Under the current trend, Nepal is expected to eradicate poverty within 20 years. [190] [191] The agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable as it is highly dependent on the monsoon rains, with just 28% of the arable land being irrigated, As of 2014 [update] . [192] Agriculture employs 76% of the workforce, services 18%, and manufacturing and craft-based industry 6%. [193] Private investment, consumption, tourism and agriculture are the principal contributors to economic growth. [189]\nThe government's budget is about $13.71 billion (FY 2019/20); [194] expenditure of infrastructure development budget, most of it contributed by foreign aid, usually fails to meet the target. [195] The country receives foreign aid from the UK, [196] [197] India, Japan, the US, the EU, China, Switzerland, and Scandinavian countries. The Nepali rupee has been tied to the Indian rupee at an exchange rate of 1.6 for many years. Per capita income is $1,004. [198] The distribution of wealth among the Nepalis is consistent with that in many developed and developing countries: the highest 10% of households control 39.1% of the national wealth and the lowest 10% control only 2.6%. European Union (EU) (46.13%), the US (17.4%), and Germany (7.1%) are its main export partners; they mainly buy Nepali ready-made garments (RMG). [199] Nepal's import partners include India (47.5%), the United Arab Emirates (11.2%), China (10.7%), Saudi Arabia (4.9%), and Singapore (4%).\nBesides having landlocked, rugged geography, few tangible natural resources and poor infrastructure, the ineffective post-1950 government and the long-running civil war are also factors in stunting the country's economic growth and development. [200] [201] [202] Debt bondage even involving debtors' children has been a persistent social problem in the western hills and the Terai , with an estimated 234,600 people or 0.82% of the population considered as enslaved, by The Global Slavery Index in 2016. [203]\nIn 2022, Nepal limited import of non-essential goods after its foreign currency reserves dropped. COVID-19 pandemic caused a decline in tourism spending and the money sent home by Nepalis working abroad, which in turn lowered country's foreign currency reserve. [204]\nTourism\nTourists view a greater one-horned rhinoceros from an elephant in Chitwan National Park .\nMain article: Tourism in Nepal\nTourism is one of the largest and fastest-growing industries in Nepal, employing more than a million people and contributing 7.9% of the total GDP. [205] The number of international visitors crossed one million in 2018 for the first time (not counting Indian tourists arriving by land). [205] [206] Nepal's share of visitors to South Asia is about 6%, and they spend much less on average, with Nepal sharing 1.7% of the earnings. [207] Premier destinations include Pokhara, the Annapurna trekking circuit and the four UNESCO world heritage sites—Lumbini, Sagarmatha National Park (home to Mount Everest), seven sites in the Kathmandu Valley collectively listed as one, and Chitwan National Park. Most of Nepal's mountaineering earning comes from Mount Everest, which is more accessible from the Nepalese side.\nNepal, officially opened to westerners in 1951, became a popular destination at the end of the hippie trail , during the 1960s and 1970s. The industry, disrupted by the civil war in the 1990s, has since recovered but faces challenges to growth, owing to a lack of proper facilities for high-end tourism termed the \"infrastructure bottleneck\", the flag carrier in shambles, and a handful of destinations properly developed and marketed. The home-stay tourism, in which cultural and eco-tourists stay as paying guests in the homes of indigenous people, has seen some success. [208]\nForeign employment\nWhile adults are employed in slavery-like conditions abroad, hundreds of thousands of children in the country are employed as child labour (not including the agricultural sector).\nThe rate of unemployment and underemployment exceeds half of the working-age population, [209] driving millions to seek employment abroad, mainly in India, the Gulf, and East Asia. Mostly unskilled, uneducated, and indebted to loan sharks, these workers are swindled by the manpower companies and sent to exploitative employers or war-ridden countries under fraudulent contracts. [210] [211] They have their passports seized, to be returned when the employer grants them leave or terminates their contracts. Most do not get paid minimum wage, [212] and many are forced to forfeit all or part of the wages. [213] Many Nepalis work in extremely unsafe conditions; an average of two workers die each day. [214] Due to restrictions placed on women, many depend on traffickers to get out of the country, and end up victims of violence and abuse. [215] Many Nepalese are believed to be working under slavery-like conditions, and Nepal spends billions of rupees rescuing stranded workers, on remuneration to the indebted families of the dead, and in legal costs for those arrested in foreign countries. [216] [217] Though millions have raised themselves out of poverty, due to a lack of entrepreneurial skills, the remittance is largely spent on real estate and consumption. [218] [217]\nInfrastructure\nEnergy\nMiddle Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Dam. Nepal has significant potential to generate hydropower , which it plans to export across South Asia.\nThe bulk of energy in Nepal comes from biomass (80%) and imported fossil fuels (16%). [219] Most of the final energy consumption goes to the residential sector (84%) followed by transport (7%) and industry (6%); the transport and industry sectors have been expanding rapidly in recent years. [219] Except for some lignite deposits, Nepal has no known oil, gas or coal deposits. [219] All commercial fossil fuels (mainly oil, LPG and coal) are imported, spending 129% of the country's total export revenue. [220] Only about 1% of the energy need is fulfilled by electricity. [219] The perennial nature of Nepali rivers and the steep gradient of the country's topography provide ideal conditions for the development of hydroelectric projects. Estimates put Nepal's economically feasible hydro-power potential at approximately 42,000 MW. [219] Nepal has been able to exploit only about 1,100 MW. As most of it is generated from run-of-river (ROR) plants, the actual power produced is much lower in the dry winter months when peak demand can reach as high as 1,200 MW, and Nepal needs to import as much as 650 MW from India to meet the demands. [221] Major hydro-power projects suffer delays and setbacks. [222] [223] [224] Nepal's electrification rate (76%) is comparable to that of other countries in the region but there is significant disparity between the rural (72%) and urban (97%) areas. [219] The position of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs, high system losses, high generation costs, high overheads, over staffing, and lower domestic demand. [225]\nTransportation\nNepal remains isolated from the world's major land, air and sea transport routes, although, within the country, aviation is in a better state, with 47 airports, 11 of them with paved runways; [226] flights are frequent and support a sizeable traffic. The hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. As of 2016 [update] , there were just over 11,890 km (7,388 mi) of paved roads, 16,100 km (10,004 mi) of unpaved roads, and just 59 km (37 mi) of railway line in the south. [226] As of 2018 [update] , all district headquarters (except Simikot ) had been connected to the road network. [171] Most of the rural roads are not operable during the rainy season; even national highways regularly become inoperable. [227] Nepal depends almost entirely on assistance from countries like China, India and Japan, for building, maintenance and expansion of the road network. The only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for Kathmandu is Kolkata in India. The national carrier, Nepal Airlines , is in poor shape due to mismanagement and corruption, and has been blacklisted by the EU. [228] Internally, the poor state of development of the road system makes access to markets, schools, and health clinics a challenge. [200]\nCommunication\nAccording to the Nepal Telecommunication Authority MIS August 2019 report, voice telephony subscription rate was at 2.70% of total population for fixed phones and 138.59% for mobile; 98% of all voice telephony was through mobile phones. [229] Similarly, while an estimated 14.52% had access to fixed broadband, an additional 52.71% were accessing the internet using their mobile data subscriptions; almost 15 million of them with 3G or better. [229] The mobile voice telephony and broadband market was dominated by two telecommunications companies, the state-owned Nepal Telecom (55%) and the private multinational, Ncell (40%). [229] Of the 21% market share enjoyed by fixed broadband, around 25% was again shared by Nepal Telecom, with the rest going to the private Internet Service Providers. [229] Although there is high disparity in penetration rate between the rural and urban areas, mobile service has reached 75 districts of the country covering 90% of land area, and broadband access is expected to reach 90% of the population by 2020. [226]\nMedia\nMain article: Mass media in Nepal\nAs of 2019 [update] , the state operates three television stations as well as national and regional radio stations. There are 117 private TV channels and 736 FM radio stations licensed for operation, at least 314 of them, community radio stations. [226] According to the 2011 census, the percentage of households possessing radio was 50.82%, television 36.45%, cable TV 19.33%, and computer 7.28%. [230] According to the Press Council Nepal classification, as of 2017 [update] of the 833 publications producing original content, ten national dailies and weeklies are rated A+ class. [231] In 2019, Reporters Without Borders ranked Nepal at 106th in the world in terms of press freedom.

The Nepali are descendants of three major migrations from India, Tibet and North Burma, and the Chinese province of Yunnan via Assam . Among the earliest inhabitants were the Kirat of the eastern region, Newars of the Kathmandu Valley , aboriginal Tharus of the Terai plains and the Khas Pahari people of the far-western hills. Despite the migration of a significant section of the population to the Terai in recent years, the majority of Nepalese still live in the central highlands, and the northern mountains are sparsely populated.\nNepal is a multicultural and multiethnic country, home to 125 distinct ethnic groups, speaking 123 different mother tongues and following a number of indigenous and folk religions in addition to Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity. [5] According to the 2011 census, Nepal's population was 26.5 million, almost a threefold increase from nine million in 1950. From 2001 to 2011, the average family size declined from 5.44 to 4.9. The census also noted some 1.9 million absentee people, over a million more than in 2001; most are male labourers employed overseas. This correlated with the drop in sex ratio to 94.2 from 99.8 for 2001. [233] The annual population growth rate was 1.35% between 2001 and 2011, compared to an average of 2.25% between 1961 and 2001; also attributed to the absentee population. [234]\nNepal is one of the ten least urbanised, and the ten fastest urbanizing countries in the world. As of 2014 [update] , an estimated 18.3% of the population lived in urban areas. Urbanisation rate is high in the Terai, doon valleys of the inner Terai and valleys of the middle hills, but low in the high Himalayas. Similarly, the rate is higher in central and eastern Nepal compared to further west. [235] The capital, Kathmandu , nicknamed the \"City of temples\", is the largest city in the country and the cultural and economic heart. Other large cities in Nepal include Pokhara , Biratnagar , Lalitpur , Bharatpur , Birgunj , Dharan , Hetauda and Nepalgunj . Congestion, pollution and drinking water shortage are some of the major problems facing the rapidly growing cities, most prominently the Kathmandu Valley.\nLargest cities\n \nv\nt\ne\nLargest cities or towns in Nepal\nCentral Bureau of Statistics 2021 Nepal census [236]\nRank\nName\nProvince\nPop.\nRank\nName\nProvince\nPop.\nKathmandu Pokhara\n1\nKathmandu\nBagmati\n845,767\n11\nJanakpur\nMadhesh\n195,438\nBharatpur Lalitpur\n2\nPokhara\nGandaki\n518,452\n12\nButwal\nLumbini\n195,054\n3\nBharatpur\nBagmati\n369,377\n13\nTulsipur\nLumbini\n180,734\n4\nLalitpur\nBagmati\n299,843\n14\nBudhanilkantha\nBagmati\n179,688\n5\nBirgunj\nMadhesh\n268,273\n15\nDharan\nKoshi Pradesh\n173,096\n6\nBiratnagar\nKoshi Pradesh\n244,750\n16\nNepalgunj\nLumbini\n166,258\n7\nDhangadhi\nSudurpashchim\n204,788\n17\nBirendranagar\nKarnali\n154,886\n8\nGhorahi\nLumbini\n201,079\n18\nTarakeshwar\nBagmati\n151,508\n9\nItahari\nKoshi Pradesh\n198,098\n19\nGokarneshwar\nBagmati\n151,200\n10\nHetauda\nBagmati\n195,951\n20\nTilottama\nLumbini\n149,657\nLanguage\nMain article: Languages of Nepal\nNepal's diverse linguistic heritage stems from three major language groups: Indo-Aryan , Tibeto-Burman , and various indigenous language isolates. The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as native language) according to the 2011 census are Nepali (44.6%), Maithili (11.7%), Bhojpuri (6.0%), Tharu (5.8%), Tamang (5.1%), Nepal Bhasa (3.2%), Bajjika (3%) and Magar (3.0%), Doteli (3.0%), Urdu (2.6%), Awadhi (1.89%), and Sunwar . Nepal is home to at least four indigenous sign languages . [ citation needed ]\nDescendent of Sanskrit , Nepali is written in Devanagari script. It is the official language and serves as lingua franca among Nepali of different ethnolinguistic groups. The regional languages Maithili , Awadhi and Bhojpuri are spoken in the southern Terai region; Urdu is common among Nepali Muslims . Varieties of Tibetan are spoken in and north of the higher Himalaya where standard literary Tibetan is widely understood by those with religious education. Local dialects in the Terai and hills are mostly unwritten with efforts underway to develop systems for writing many in Devanagari or the Roman alphabet. [ citation needed ]\nReligion\nMain article: Religion in Nepal\nSadhus in Pashupatinath Temple\nNepal is a secular country, as declared by the Constitution of Nepal 2012 (Part 1, Article 4), where secularism 'means religious, cultural freedom, along with the protection of religion, culture handed down from time immemorial ( सनातन )'. [237] [238] The 2011 census reported that the religion with the largest number of followers in Nepal was Hinduism (81.3% of the population), followed by Buddhism (9%); the remaining were Islam (4.4%), Kirant (3.1%), Christianity (1.4%) and Prakriti or nature worship (0.5%). [239] By percentage of population, Nepal has the largest population of Hindus in the world. [240] Nepal was officially a Hindu Kingdom until recently, and Shiva was considered the guardian deity of the country. [241] Although many government policies throughout history have disregarded or marginalised minority religions, Nepalese societies generally enjoy religious tolerance and harmony among all religions, with only isolated incidents of religiously motivated violence. [242] [243] Nepal's constitution does not give anyone the right to convert any person to another religion. Nepal also passed a more stringent anti-conversion law on 2017. [244] Nepal has the second-largest number of Hindus in the world after India. [245]\nEducation\nMain article: Education in Nepal\nNepal entered modernity in 1951 with a literacy rate of 5% and about 10,000 students enrolled in 300 schools. [ citation needed ] By 2017, there were more than seven million students enrolled in 35,601 schools. [246] The overall literacy rate (for population age 5 years and above) increased from 54.1% in 2001 to 65.9% in 2011. [5] The net primary enrolment rate reached 97% by 2017, [247] [248] yet enrolment was less than 60% at the secondary level (grades 9 –12), [249] and around 12% at the tertiary level. [249] Though there is significant gender disparity in overall literacy rate, [5] girls have overtaken boys in enrolment to all levels of education. [249] Nepal has eleven universities and four independent science academies. [246] Nepal was ranked 111st in the Global Innovation Index in 2021, down from 109th in 2019. [250] [251] [252] [253]\nLack of proper infrastructures and teaching materials, and a high student-to-teacher ratio, as well as politicisation of school management committees [254] and partisan unionisation among both students and teachers, [255] present a hurdle to progress. Free basic education is guaranteed in the constitution but the programme lacks funding for effective implementation. [256] Government has scholarship programmes for girls and disabled students as well as the children of martyrs, marginalised communities and the poor. [257] [258] Tens of thousands of Nepali students leave the country every year in search of better education and work, with half of them never returning. [259] [260]\nHealth\nMain article: Health in Nepal\nHistorical development of life expectancy in Nepal\nHealth care services in Nepal are provided by both the public and private sectors. Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 71 years as of 2017, 153rd highest in the world, [261] up from 54 years in the 1990s and 35 years in 1950. [262] [263] Two-thirds of all deaths are due to non-communicable diseases; heart disease is the leading cause of death. [264] While sedentary lifestyle, imbalanced diet and consumption of tobacco and alcohol has contributed in the rise of non-communicable diseases, many lose their life to communicable and treatable diseases caused by poor sanitation and malnutrition due to a lack of education, awareness and access to healthcare services. [264] [265]\nNepal has made great progress in maternal and child health. 95% of children have access to iodised salt, and 86% of children aged 6 – 59 months receive Vitamin A prophylaxis. [266] Stunting, underweight and wasting has been reduced significantly; [266] malnutrition, at 43% among children under five, is extremely high. [267] Anemia in women and children increased between 2011 and 2016, reaching 41% and 53% respectively. [267] Low birth weight is at 27% while breastfeeding is at 65%. [267] Nepal has reduced maternal mortality rate to 229, [268] from 901 in 1990; [269] [268] infant mortality is down to 32.2 per thousand live births compared to 139.8 in 1990. [270] Contraceptive prevalence rate is 53% but the disparity rate between rural and urban areas is high due to a lack of awareness and easy access. [271]\nProgress in health is driven by strong government initiative in cooperation with NGOs and INGOs. Public health centres provide 72 essential medicines free of cost. In addition, the public health insurance plan initiated in 2016 which covers health treatments of up to Rs 50,000 for five members of a family, for a premium of Rs 2500 per year, has seen limited success, and is expected to expand. [272] By paying stipends for four antenatal visits to health centres and hospitalised delivery, Nepal decreased home-births from 81% in 2006 [269] to 41% in 2016. [273] School meal programmes have improved education as well as nutrition metrics among children. [274] Toilet building subsidies under the ambitious \"one household-one toilet\" programme has seen toilet prevalence rate reach 99% in 2019, from just 6% in 1990. [275]\nImmigrants and refugees\nMain article: Demographics of Nepal § Foreign population in Nepal\nNepal has a long tradition of accepting immigrants and refugees. [276] In modern times, Tibetans and Bhutanese have constituted a majority of refugees in Nepal. Tibetan refugees began arriving in 1959, [277] and many more cross into Nepal every year. [278] The Bhutanese Lhotsampa refugees began arriving in the 1980s and numbered more than 110,000 by the 2000s. Most of them have been resettled in third countries. [279] In late 2018, Nepal had a total of 20,800 confirmed refugees, 64% of them Tibetan and 31% Bhutanese. [280] Economic immigrants, and refugees fleeing persecution or war, from neighbouring countries, Africa and the Middle East, termed \"urban refugees\" because they live in apartments in the cities instead of refugee camps, [281] [282] [283] lack official recognition; the government facilitates their resettlement in third countries. [284]\nAround 2,000 immigrants, half of them Chinese, applied for a work permit in 2018/19. The government lacks data on Indian immigrants as they do not require permits to live and work in Nepal; [285]\nGovernment of India puts the number of Non-Resident Indians in the country at 600,000. [286]\nCulture\nMain article: Culture of Nepal\nA Magar couple in their ethnic dress\nSociety\nTraditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Nepali caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in South Asia. Social classes are defined by more than a hundred endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis , or \"castes\". Nepal declared untouchability to be illegal in 1963 [287] and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. At the workplace and educational institutions in urban Nepal, caste-related identification has pretty much lost its importance. [ citation needed ]\nFamily values are important in the Nepali tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in Nepal, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority of Nepalis, with or without their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders. Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low, with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce. [288]\nChild marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18. [289]\nMany Nepali festivals are religious in origin. The best known include: Dashain , Tihar , Teej , Chhath , Maghi , Sakela , Holi , Eid ul-Fitr , Christmas , and the Nepali new year .\nSymbols\nMain article: National symbols of Nepal\nNational symbols\nFlag of Nepal Emblem Emblem of Nepal Anthem Sayaun Thunga Phulka Language All mother-tongues of Nepal Currency Nepalese rupee (रू) (NPR) Bird Himalayan monal Flower Rhododendron arboreum [291] Mammal Cow [290] Colour  \nCrimson Sport Volleyball [292]\nThe emblem of Nepal depicts the snowy Himalayas, the forested hills, and the fertile Terai, supported by a wreath of rhododendrons, with the national flag at the crest and in the foreground, a plain white map of Nepal below it, and a man's and woman's right hands joined to signify gender equality. At the bottom is the national motto, a Sanskrit quote of patriotism attributed in Nepali folklore to Lord Rama, written in Devanagari script—\" Mother and motherland are greater than heaven \". [ citation needed ]\nNepal's flag is the only national flag in the world that is not rectangular in shape. [293] The constitution contains instructions for a Geometric Construction of the double-pennant flag. [294] According to its official description, the crimson in the flag stands for victory in war or courage, and is also the colour of the rhododendron . The flag's blue border signifies Nepali people's desire for peace. The moon on the flag is a symbol of the peaceful and calm nature of Nepalis, while the sun represents the aggressiveness of Nepali warriors.\nThe president is the symbol of national unity. The martyrs are the symbols of patriotism. Commanders of the Anglo-Nepalese war, Amar Singh Thapa , Bhakti Thapa , and Balbhadra Kunwar are considered war heroes. A special designation of \"National hero\" has been conferred to 16 people from Nepal's history for their exceptional contributions to the prestige of Nepal. Prithvi Narayan Shah, the founder of modern Nepal, is held in high regard and considered \"Father of the Nation\" by many. [295] [296]\nArt and architecture\nMain article: Architecture of Nepal\nClockwise from top-left: (a) Nyatapola , a five storied pagoda in Bhaktapur, bejewelled with characteristic stone, metal and wood craftsmanship, has survived at least four major earthquakes. [297] Pagodas, now an indispensable part of East Asian architecture, are conjectured to have been transmitted to China from Nepal. (b) Nepali stonecraft in a royal water spout (c) A traditional Newar \"Ankhijhyal\" window in the form of a peacock\nThe oldest known examples of architecture in Nepal are stupas of early Buddhist constructions in and around Kapilvastu in south-western Nepal, and those constructed by Ashoka in the Kathmandu Valley\nc.  250 BC. The characteristic architecture associated exclusively with Nepal was developed and refined by Newa artisans of the Kathmandu Valley starting no later than the Lichchhavi period. A Tang dynasty Chinese travel book, probably based on records from c. 650 AD, describes contemporary Nepali architecture, predominantly built with wood, as rich in artistry, as well as wood and metal sculpture. It describes a magnificent seven-storied pagoda in the middle of a palace, with copper-tiled roofs, its balustrade, grills, columns and beams set about with fine and precious stones, and four golden sculptures of Makaras in the four corners of the base spouting water from their mouths like a fountain, supplied by copper pipes connected to the runnels at the top of the tower. Later Chinese chronicles describe Nepal's king's palace as an immense structure with many roofs, suggesting that Chinese were not yet familiar with the pagoda architecture, which has now become one of the chief characteristic of Chinese architecture.\nA typical pagoda temple is built with wood, every piece of it finely carved with geometrical patterns or images of gods, goddesses, mythical beings and beasts. The roofs usually tiled with clay, and sometimes gold plated, diminish in proportion successively until the topmost roof is reached which is itself ensigned by a golden finial. The base is usually composed of rectangular terraces of finely carved stone; the entrance is usually guarded by stone sculptures of conventional figures. Bronze and copper craftsmanship observable in the sculpture of deities and beasts, decorations of doors and windows and the finials of buildings, as well as items of every day use is found to be of equal splendour. The most well-developed of Nepali painting traditions is the thanka or paubha painting tradition of Tibetan Buddhism , practised in Nepal by the Buddhist monks and Newar artisans. Changu Narayan Temple , built c. fourth century AD has probably the finest of Nepali woodcraft; the Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares are the culmination of Nepali art and architecture, showcasing Nepali wood, metal and stone craftsmanship refined over two millennia. [298]\nThe \"ankhijhyal\" window , that allow a one-way view of the outside world, is an example of unique Nepali woodcraft, found in building structures, domestic and public alike, ancient and modern. Many cultures paint the walls of their homes with regular patterns, figures of gods and beasts and religious symbols; others paint their walls plain, often with clay or chernozem contrasted with yellow soil or limestone. The roofs of religious as well as domestic structures project considerably, presumably to provide protection from the sun and the rain. The timber of domestic structures are finely carved as with their religious counterparts. [298]\nLiterature and the performing arts\nMain articles: Nepalese literature , Music of Nepal , and Cinema of Nepal\nBhanubhakta Acharya , Nepali writer who translated the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana in the Nepali language\nNepal's literature was closely intertwined with that of the rest of South Asia until its unification into a modern kingdom. Literary works, which were written in Sanskrit by Brahmin priests educated and sometimes also based in Varanasi, included religious texts and other fantasies involving kings, gods and demons. [299] The oldest extant Nepali language text is dated to the 13th century but except for the epigraphic material, Nepali language literature older than the 17th century haven't been found. Newar literature dates back almost 500 years. [296] The modern history of Nepali literature begins with Bhanubhakta Acharya (1814–1868), who for the first time composed major and influential works in Nepali, the language accessible to the masses, most prominently, the Bhanubhakta Ramayana , a translation of the ancient Hindu epic. [299] By the end of the nineteenth century, Motiram Bhatta had published print editions of the works of Acharya, and through his efforts, single-handedly popularised and propelled Nepali language literature into modernity. [296] By the mid-twentieth century, Nepali literature was no longer limited to the Hindu literary traditions. Influenced by western literary traditions, writers in this period started producing literary works addressing the contemporary social problems, [300] while many others continued to enrich Nepali poetic traditions with authentic Nepali poetry. Newar literature also emerged as a premier literary tradition. After the advent of democracy in 1951, Nepali literature flourished. Literary works in many other languages began to be produced. Nepali literature continued to modernise, and in recent years, has been strongly influenced by the post civil-war Nepali experience as well as global literary traditions. [301] [302] [303] [296]\nMaruni , Lakhey , Sakela , Kauda and Tamang Selo are some examples of the traditional Nepali music and dance in the hilly regions of Nepal.\nNepali film industry is known as \"Kollywood\". [304]\nNepal Academy is the foremost institution for the promotion of arts and culture in Nepal, established in 1957. [296]\nClothing\nA Nepali man in Daura-Suruwal, coat and Dhaka topi, displays the bhoto during the Bhoto Jatra festival.\nThe most widely worn traditional dress in Nepal, for both women and men, from ancient times until the advent of modern times, was draped. [305] For women, it eventually took the form of a sari , a single long piece of cloth, famously six yards long, and of width spanning the lower body. [305] The sari is tied around the waist and knotted at one end, wrapped around the lower body, and then over the shoulder. [305] In its more modern form, it has been used to cover the head, and sometimes the face, as a veil, [305] particularly in the Terai. It has been combined with an underskirt, or the petticoat , and tucked in the waistband for more secure fastening. It is worn with a blouse , or cholo , which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end, passing over the shoulder, now serving to obscure the upper body's contours, and to cover the midriff. [305] Cholo-sari has become the attire of choice for formal occasions, official environs and festive gatherings. In its more traditional form, as part of traditional dresses and as worn in daily life while performing household chores or labour, it takes the form of a fariya or gunyu , usually shorter than a sari in length as well as breadth, and all of it wrapped around the lower body.\nFor men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti , has served as a lower-body garment. [306] It too is tied around the waist and wrapped. [306] Among the Aryans, it is also wrapped once around each leg before being brought up through the legs to be tucked in at the back. Dhoti or its variants, usually worn over a langauti , constitute the lower-body garment in the traditional clothing of Tharus, Gurungs and Magars as well as the Madhesi people, among others. Other forms of traditional apparel that involve no stitching or tailoring are patukas (a length of cloth wrapped tightly over the waist by both sexes as a waistband, a part of most traditional Nepali costumes, usually with a khukuri tucked into it when worn by men), scarves like pachhyauras and majetros and shawls like the newar ga and Tibetan khata , ghumtos (the wedding veils) and various kinds of turbans (scarves worn around the head as a part of a tradition, or to keep off the sun or the cold, [306] called a pheta , pagri or sirpau).\nUntil the beginning of the first millennium AD, the ordinary dress of people in South Asia was entirely unstitched. [307] The arrival of the Kushans from Central Asia , c.  48 AD, popularised cut and sewn garments in the style of Central Asia. [307] The simplest form of sewn clothing, Bhoto (a rudimentary vest), is a universal unisex clothing for children, and traditionally the only clothing children wear until they come of age and are given adult garb, sometimes in a ceremonial rite of passage, such as the gunyu-choli ceremony for Hindu girls. Men continue to wear bhoto through adulthood. Upper body garment for men is usually a vest such as the bhoto , or a shirt similar to the kurta , such as daura , a closed-necked double-breasted long shirt with five pleats and eight strings that serve to tie it around the body. Suruwal , simply translated as a pair of trousers, is an alternative to and, more recently, replacement for dhoti , kachhad (Magars) or lungi (Tharus); it is traditionally much wider above the knees but tapers below, to fit tightly at the ankles, and is tied to the waist with a drawstring. Modern cholos worn with sarees are usually half-sleeved and single-breasted, and do not cover the midriff. The traditional one called the chaubandi cholo, like the daura, is full-sleeved, double-breasted with pleats and strings, and extends down to the patuka, covering the midriff.\nDaura-Suruwal and Gunyu-Cholo were the national dresses for men and women respectively until 2011 when they were removed to eliminate favouritism. [308] Traditional dresses of many pahari ethnic groups are Daura-Suruwal or similar, with patuka, a dhaka topi and a coat for men, and Gunyu-cholo or similar, with patuka and sometimes a scarf for women. For many other groups, men's traditional dresses consist of a shirt or a vest, paired with a dhoti , kachhad or lungi . In the high Himalayas, the traditional dresses are largely influenced by Tibetan culture. Sherpa women wear the chuba with the pangi apron, while Sherpa men wear shirts with stiff high collar and long sleeves called tetung under the chuba. Tibetan Xamo Gyaise hats of the Sherpas, dhaka topi of pahari men and tamang round caps are among the more distinctive headwears.\nMarried Hindu women wear tika , sindur , pote and red bangles. Jewellery of gold and silver, and sometimes precious stones, are common. Gold jewellery includes mangalsutras and tilaharis worn with the pote by the Hindus, samyafung (a huge gold flower worn on the head) and Nessey (huge flattened gold earrings) worn by the Limbus, and sirphuli , sirbandhi and chandra worn by the Magars. Tharu women can wear as much as six kilograms of silver in jewellery, which includes mangiya worn on the head, tikuli the forehead, and kanseri and tikahamala around the neck. [309]\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in Nepal. Increasingly, in urban settings, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, transformed instead into one for formal occasions. The traditional kurta suruwal is rarely worn by younger women, who increasingly favour jeans. The dhoti has largely been reduced to the liturgical\nvestment of shamans and Hindu priests.\nCuisine\nMain article: Nepalese cuisine\nA dal-bhat thali with boiled rice, lentil soup, fried leafy greens, vegetable curry, yoghurt, papad and vegetable salad\nNepali cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other, using locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruit. [310] The Columbian exchange had brought the potato, the tomato, maize, peanuts, cashew nuts, pineapples, guavas, and most notably, chilli peppers , to South Asia. Each became staples of use. [311] The cereals grown in Nepal, their choice, times, and regions of planting, correspond strongly to the timing of Nepal's monsoons, [312] and the variations in altitude. Rice and wheat are mostly cultivated in the terai plains and well-irrigated valleys, and maize, millet, barley and buckwheat in the lesser fertile and drier hills. [310] [313]\nThe foundation of a typical Nepali meal is a cereal cooked in plain fashion, and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes. [314] The latter includes lentils , pulses and vegetables spiced commonly with ginger and garlic , but also more discerningly with a combination of spices that may include coriander , cumin , turmeric , cinnamon , cardamon , jimbu and others as informed by culinary conventions. [314] In an actual meal, this mental representation takes the form of a platter, or thali , with a central place for the cooked cereal, peripheral ones, often in small bowls, for the flavourful accompaniments, and the simultaneous, rather than piecemeal, ingestion of the two in each act of eating, whether by actual mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or in the folding of one—such as bread—around the other, such as cooked vegetables. [314]\nDal-bhat , centred around steamed rice is the most common example. [315] as well as dairy and sometimes meat, is the most common and prominent example. The unleavened flat bread made from wheat flour called chapati occasionally replaces the steamed rice, particularly in the Terai, while Dhindo, prepared by boiling corn, millet or buckwheat flour in water, continuously stirring and adding flour until thick, almost solid consistency is reached, is the main substitute in the hills and mountains. Tsampa, flour made from roasted barley or naked barley, is the main staple in the high himalayas. Throughout Nepal, fermented, then sun-dried, leafy greens called Gundruk , are both a delicacy and a vital substitute for fresh vegetables in the winter. [313]\nMomo dumplings with chutney\nA notable feature of Nepali food is the existence of a number of distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents. [316] The appearance of ahimsa , or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in South Asian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism , Buddhism and Jainism , is thought to have been a notable factor in the prevalence of vegetarianism among a segment of Nepal's Hindu and Buddhist populations, as well as among Jains. [316] Among these groups, strong discomfort is felt at thoughts of eating meat. [317] Though per capita meat consumption is low in Nepal, the proportion of vegetarianism is not high as in India, due to the prevalence of Shaktism , of which animal sacrifice is a prominent feature. [318]\nSamayabaji (Newar cuisine)\nNepali cuisines possess their own distinctive qualities to distinguish these hybrid cuisines from both their northern and southern neighbours. [319] [315] Nepali cuisines, with generally tomato-based, leaner curries, are lighter than their cream-based Indian counterparts, and Nepali momo dumplings are heavily spiced compared to their northern counterparts. [315] Newar cuisine, one of the richest and most influential in Nepal, is more elaborate and diverse than most, as Newar culture developed in the highly fertile and prosperous Kathmandu valley. [310] A typical Newar cuisine can comprise more than a dozen dishes of cereals, meat, vegetable curries, chutneys and pickles. Kwanti (sprouted beans soup), chhwela (ground beef), chatamari (rice flour crepe), bara (fried lentil cake), kachila (marinated raw minced beef), samaybaji (centred around flattened rice), lakhaamari and yomuri are among the more widely recognised. [315] [320] Juju dhau, a sweet yoghurt originating in Bhaktapur, is also famous. [315] Thakali cuisine is another well-known food tradition which seamlessly melds the Tibetan and the Indian with variety in ingredients, especially the herbs and spices. [310] In the Terai, Bagiya is a rice flour dumpling with sweets inside, popular among the Tharu and Maithil people. Various communities in the Terai make sidhara (sun-dried small fish mixed with taro leaves) and biriya (lentil paste mixed with taro leaves) to stock for the monsoon floods. [310]\nSelroti , kasaar , fini and chaku are among the sweet delicacies. Rice pulau or sweet rice porridge called kheer are usually the main dish in feasts. [313] Tea and buttermilk (fermented milk leftover from churning butter from yoghurt) are common non-alcoholic drinks. Almost all janajati communities have their own traditional methods of brewing alcohol. Raksi (traditional distilled alcohol), jaand (rice beer), tongba (millet beer) and chyaang are the most well-known.\nSports and recreation\nMain article: Sports in Nepal\nNepali children playing a variant of knucklebones, with pebbles\nNepali indigenous sports, like dandi biyo and kabaddi which were considered the unofficial national sports until recently, [292] are still popular in rural areas. [321] Despite efforts, standardisation and development of dandi biyo has not been achieved, [322] [323] while Kabaddi, as a professional sport, is still in its infancy in Nepal. [324]\nBagh-Chal , an ancient board game that's thought to have originated in Nepal, can be played on chalk-drawn boards, with pebbles, and is still popular today. [325] [326]\nLudo , snakes and ladders and carrom are popular pastimes. [327]\nChess is also played. [321]\nVolleyball was declared as the national sport of Nepal in 2017. [292] Popular children's games include versions of tag , [321]\nknucklebones , [321]\nhopscotch , Duck, duck, goose [321] and lagori , while marbles , [321]\ntop , hoop rolling and gully cricket are also popular among boys. Rubber bands , or ranger bands cut from tubes in bike tyres, make a multi-purpose sporting equipment for Nepali children, which may be bunched or chained together, and used to play dodgeball , cat's cradle , jianzi [321] and a variety of skipping rope games. [321]\nNepali cricket fans are renowned for their exceptionally enthusiastic support of their national team. [328] [329]\nFootball and cricket are popular professional sports. [330] Nepal is competitive in football in the South Asia region but has never won the SAFF championships , the regional tournament. [331] [332] It usually ranks in the bottom quarter in the FIFA World Rankings . [333] Nepal has had success in cricket and holds the elite ODI status , [334] [335] consistently ranking in the Top 20 in the ICC\nODI and T20I rankings . [336] [337] Nepal has had some success in athletics and martial arts , having won many medals at the South Asian Games and some at the Asian games . [338] Nepal has never won an olympic medal. [339] Sports like basketball , volleyball, futsal , wrestling , competitive bodybuilding [339] [340] and badminton are also gaining in popularity. [321] Women in football, cricket, athletics, martial arts, badminton and swimming have found some success. [341] [339] Nepal also fields players and national teams in several tournaments for disabled individuals, most notably in men's [342] as well as women's blind cricket. [343]\nThe only international stadium in the country is the multi-purpose Dasarath Stadium where the men and women national football teams play their home matches. [344] Since the formation of the national team , Nepal has played its home matches of cricket at Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground . [345] Nepal police, Armed police force and Nepal army are the most prolific producers of national players, and aspiring players are known to join armed forces, for the better sporting opportunities they can provide. [346] [347] Nepali sports is hindered by a lack of infrastructure, [348] funding, [342] corruption, nepotism and political interference. [338] [349] [350] Very few players are able to make a living as professional sportspeople.

[1]\nA normal route or normal way ( French : voie normale ; German : Normalweg ) is the most frequently used route for ascending and descending a mountain peak . It is usually the simplest route. [2] [3]\nOverview [ edit ]\nIn the Alps , routes are classed in the following ways, based on their waymarking, construction and upkeep:\nFootpaths ( Fußwege )\nHiking trails ( Wanderwege )\nMountain trails ( Bergwege )\nAlpine routes ( Alpine Routen )\nClimbing routes ( Kletterrouten ) and High Alpine routes ( Hochalpine Routen ) in combined rock and ice terrain, ( UIAA ) graded by difficulty\nSometimes the normal route is not the easiest ascent to the summit, but just the one that is most used. There may be technically easier variations. This is especially the case on the Watzmannfrau , the Hochkalter and also Mount Everest . There may be many reasons these easier options are less well-used:\nthe simplest route is less well known than the normal route (Watzmannfrau).\nthe technically easiest route is more arduous than another (e.g. due to rubble) and is therefore mainly used on the descent (Hochkalter).\nthe technically easiest route carries a much higher risk of e.g. rockfalls or avalanche and is therefore avoided in favour of a more difficult route ( Watzespitze ).\nthe technically easier route requires a complicated or long approach march, or all access may be banned via one country (Mount Everest).\nThe term tourist route may sometimes be applied (irrespective of the level of difficulty of ascent) by those wishing to suggest that other routes up a mountain are somehow more \"worthy\". This belittling of the \"normal route\" therefore maintains a distinction between those perceiving themselves as serious mountaineers who disparage the incursion of tourist climbers into their domain (hence the term the \"Yak Route\" on Mount Everest).

It is the world's fifth-most populous country , with a population of almost 243 million people, and has the world's second-largest Muslim population just behind Indonesia . [16] Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country in the world by area and the second-largest in South Asia , spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square miles). It has a 1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south, and is bordered by India to the east , Afghanistan to the west , Iran to the southwest , and China to the northeast . It is separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman . Islamabad is the nation's capital, while Karachi is its largest city and financial centre.\nPakistan is the site of several ancient cultures , including the Paleolithic\nSoanian culture , the Neolithic site of Mehrgarh , [17] the Indus Valley civilisation of the Bronze Age , the most extensive of the civilisations of the Afro-Eurasia , [18] [19] and the ancient Gandhara civilisation . [20] The regions that comprise the modern state of Pakistan were the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid , the Maurya , the Kushan , the Gupta ; [21] the Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the Samma , the Hindu Shahis , the Shah Miris , the Ghaznavids , the Delhi Sultanate , the Mughals , [22] and most recently, the British Raj from 1858 to 1947.\nSpurred by the Pakistan Movement , which sought a homeland for the Muslims of British India , and election victories in 1946 by the All-India Muslim League , Pakistan gained independence in 1947 after the Partition of the British Indian Empire , which awarded separate statehood to its Muslim-majority regions and was accompanied by an unparalleled mass migration and loss of life. [23] Initially a Dominion of the British Commonwealth , Pakistan officially drafted its constitution in 1956, and emerged as a declared Islamic republic . In 1971, the exclave of East Pakistan seceded as the new country of Bangladesh after a nine-month-long civil war . In the following four decades, Pakistan has been ruled by governments whose descriptions, although complex, commonly alternated between civilian and military, democratic and authoritarian, relatively secular and Islamist . [24] Pakistan elected a civilian government in 2008, and in 2010 adopted a parliamentary system with periodic elections. [25]\nPakistan is a middle power nation, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] and has the world's sixth-largest standing armed forces . It is a declared nuclear-weapons state , and is ranked amongst the emerging and growth-leading economies , [32] with a large and rapidly-growing middle class. [33] Pakistan's political history since independence has been characterised by periods of significant economic and military growth as well as those of political and economic instability. It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with similarly diverse geography and wildlife . The country continues to face challenges, including poverty , illiteracy , corruption and terrorism . [34] Pakistan is a member of the United Nations , the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , the Commonwealth of Nations , the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation , and the Islamic Military Counter-Terrorism Coalition , and is designated as a major non-NATO ally by the United States .\nEtymology\nThe name Pakistan was coined by Choudhry Rahmat Ali , a Pakistan Movement activist, who in January 1933 first published it in a pamphlet Now or Never , using it as an acronym . [35] Rahmat Ali explained: \"It is composed of letters taken from the names of all our homelands, Indian and Asian, P anjab , A fghania , K ashmir , S indh , and Baluchis tan .\" He added that \"Pakistan is both a Persian and Urdu word... It means the land of the Paks, the spiritually pure and clean.\" [36] Etymologists note that پاک\npāk , is 'pure' in Persian and Pashto [37] and the Persian suffix ـستان\n-stan means 'land' or 'place of'. [38] [39] [40] [41]\nRahmat Ali’s concept of Pakistan only related to the north-west area of the Indian subcontinent. He also proposed the name \"Banglastan\" for the Muslim areas of Bengal and \"Osmanistan\" for Hyderabad State , as well as a political federation between the three. [42] [43]\nHistory\nMain articles: History of Pakistan , Indus Valley civilisation , Vedic period , Maurya Empire , Indo-Greek Kingdom , Gupta Empire , Kushan Empire , Sikh Empire , and Mughal Empire\nSee also: Outline of South Asian history\nIndus Valley Civilization\nPriest-King Statue from Mohenjo-Daro (c. 2500 BCE)\nSome of the earliest ancient human civilisations in South Asia originated from areas encompassing present-day Pakistan. [44] The earliest known inhabitants in the region were Soanian during the Lower Paleolithic , of whom stone tools have been found in the Soan Valley of Punjab . [45] The Indus region , which covers most of present day Pakistan, was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the Neolithic Mehrgarh [46] and the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilisation [47] [48] (2,800–1,800 BCE) at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro . [49]\nVedic Period\nStanding Buddha from Gandhara , Greco-Buddhist art , 1st–2nd century CE\nThe Vedic period (1500–500 BCE) was characterised by an Indo-Aryan culture; during this period the Vedas , the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism , were composed, and this culture later became well established in the region. [50]\nMultan was an important Hindu pilgrimage centre. [51] The Vedic civilisation flourished in the ancient Gandhāran city of Takṣaśilā, now Taxila in the Punjab, which was founded around 1000 BCE. [52] [46]\nEarly Medieval Period\nSuccessive ancient empires and kingdoms ruled the region: the Persian Achaemenid Empire (around 519 BCE), Alexander the Great 's empire in 326 BCE [53] and the Maurya Empire , founded by Chandragupta Maurya and extended by Ashoka the Great , until 185 BCE. The Indo-Greek Kingdom founded by Demetrius of Bactria (180–165 BCE) included Gandhara and Punjab and reached its greatest extent under Menander (165–150 BCE), prospering the Greco-Buddhist culture in the region. [46] [54] Taxila had one of the earliest universities and centres of higher education in the world, which was established during the late Vedic period in 6th century BCE. [55] [56] The school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious instruction was provided on an individualistic basis. [56] The ancient university was documented by the invading forces of Alexander the Great and was also recorded by Chinese pilgrims in the 4th or 5th century CE. [57]\nAt its zenith, the Rai Dynasty (489–632 CE) of Sindh ruled this region and the surrounding territories. [58]\nIslamic conquest\nThe Arab conqueror Muhammad ibn Qasim conquered Sindh in 711 CE. [59] [60] The Pakistan government's official chronology claims this as the time when the foundation of Pakistan was laid [59] [61] but the concept of Pakistan arrived in the 19th century. The Early Medieval period (642–1219 CE) witnessed the spread of Islam in the region. During this period, Sufi\nmissionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional Buddhist and Hindu population to Islam. [62] Upon the defeat of the Turk and Hindu Shahi dynasties which governed the Kabul Valley , Gandhara (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkwa), and western Punjab in the 7th to 11th centuries CE, several successive Muslim empires ruled over the region, including the Ghaznavid Empire (975–1187 CE), the Ghorid Kingdom, and the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526 CE). The Lodi dynasty , the last of the Delhi Sultanate, was replaced by the Mughal Empire (1526–1857 CE).\nBadshahi Mosque , Lahore\nThe Mughals introduced Persian literature and high culture, establishing the roots of Indo-Persian culture in the region. [63] In the region of modern-day Pakistan, key cities during the Mughal period were Lahore and Thatta , [64] both of which were chosen as the site of impressive Mughal buildings . [65] In the early 16th century, the region remained under the Mughal Empire . [66]\nIn the 18th century, the slow disintegration of the Mughal Empire was hastened by the emergence of the rival powers of the Maratha Confederacy and later the Sikh Empire , as well as invasions by Nader Shah from Iran in 1739 and the Durrani Empire of Afghanistan in 1759. The growing political power of the British in Bengal had not yet reached the territories of modern Pakistan.\nColonial period\nMain articles: British India , Aligarh Movement , and British Raj\nSir Syed Ahmad Khan (1817–1898), whose vision formed the basis of Pakistan\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah (1876–1948) served as Pakistan's first Governor-General and the leader of the Pakistan Movement .\nNone of the territory of modern Pakistan was ruled by the British, or other European powers, until 1839, when Karachi , then a small fishing village with a mud fort guarding the harbour, was taken , and held as an enclave with a port and military base for the First Afghan War that soon followed. The rest of Sindh was taken in 1843, and in the following decades, first the East India Company , and then after the post- Sepoy Mutiny (1857–1858) direct rule of Queen Victoria of the British Empire , took over most of the country partly through wars, and also treaties. The main wars were that against the Baloch\nTalpur dynasty , ended by the Battle of Miani (1843) in Sindh, the Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845–1849) and the Anglo-Afghan Wars (1839–1919). By 1893, all modern Pakistan was part of the British Indian Empire , and remained so until independence in 1947.\nUnder the British, modern Pakistan was mostly divided into the Sind Division , Punjab Province , and the Baluchistan Agency . There were various princely states , of which the largest was Bahawalpur .\nA rebellion in 1857 called the Sepoy mutiny of Bengal was the region's major armed struggle against the British. [67] Divergence in the relationship between Hinduism and Islam created a major rift in British India that led to motivated religious violence in British India . [68] The language controversy further escalated the tensions between Hindus and Muslims. [69] The Hindu renaissance witnessed an awakening of intellectualism in traditional Hinduism and saw the emergence of more assertive influence in the social and political spheres in British India. [70] A Muslim intellectual movement , founded by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan to counter the Hindu renaissance, envisioned as well as advocated for the two-nation theory [71] and led to the creation of the All-India Muslim League in 1906. In contrast to the Indian National Congress 's anti-British efforts, the Muslim League was a pro-British movement whose political program inherited the British values that would shape Pakistan's future civil society . [72] The largely non-violent independence struggle led by the Indian Congress engaged millions of protesters in mass campaigns of civil disobedience in the 1920s and 1930s against the British Empire . [73] [74]\nClock Tower, Faisalabad , built by the British government in the 19th century\nThe Muslim League slowly rose to mass popularity in the 1930s amid fears of under-representation and neglect by the British of the Indian Muslims in politics . In his presidential address of 29 December 1930, Allama Iqbal called for \"the amalgamation of North-West Muslim-majority Indian states\" consisting of Punjab , North-West Frontier Province , Sind , and Baluchistan . [75] The perceived neglect of Muslim interests by Congress led British provincial governments during the period of 1937–39 convinced Muhammad Ali Jinnah , the founder of Pakistan to espouse the two-nation theory and led the Muslim League to adopt the Lahore Resolution of 1940 presented by Sher-e-Bangla\nA.K. Fazlul Haque , popularly known as the Pakistan Resolution. [71] In World War II , Jinnah and British-educated\nfounding fathers in the Muslim League supported the United Kingdom's war efforts , countering opposition against it whilst working towards Sir Syed's vision . [76]\nPakistan Movement\nMain article: Pakistan Movement\nFurther information: History of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan , Indian independence movement , and Partition of India\nThe 1946 elections resulted in the Muslim League winning 90 percent of the seats reserved for Muslims. Thus, the 1946 election was effectively a plebiscite in which the Indian Muslims were to vote on the creation of Pakistan, a plebiscite won by the Muslim League. This victory was assisted by the support given to the Muslim League by the support of the landowners of Sindh and Punjab. The Indian National Congress, which initially denied the Muslim League's claim of being the sole representative of Indian Muslims, was now forced to recognise the fact. [77] The British had no alternative except to take Jinnah's views into account as he had emerged as the sole spokesperson of the entirety of British India's Muslims. However, the British did not want colonial India to be partitioned , and in one last effort to prevent it, they devised the Cabinet Mission plan . [78]\nAs the cabinet mission failed, the British government announced its intention to end the British Rule in 1946–47. [79]\nNationalists in British India—including Jawaharlal Nehru and Abul Kalam Azad of Congress, Jinnah of the All-India Muslim League , and Master Tara Singh representing the Sikhs—agreed to the proposed terms of transfer of power and independence in June 1947 with the Viceroy of India , Lord Mountbatten of Burma . [80] As the United Kingdom agreed to the partitioning of India in 1947, the modern state of Pakistan was established on 14 August 1947\n(27th of Ramadan in 1366 of the Islamic Calendar ) , amalgamating the Muslim-majority eastern and northwestern regions of British India . [74] It comprised the provinces of Balochistan , East Bengal , the North-West Frontier Province , West Punjab , and Sindh. [71] [80]\nIn the riots that accompanied the partition in Punjab Province, it is believed that between 200,000 and 2,000,000 [81] people were killed in what some have described as a retributive genocide between the religions [82] while 50,000 Muslim women were abducted and raped by Hindu and Sikh men, 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women also experienced the same fate at the hands of Muslims. [83] Around 6.5 million Muslims moved from India to West Pakistan and 4.7 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from West Pakistan to India. [84] It was the largest mass migration in human history. [85] A subsequent dispute over the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir eventually sparked the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948 . [86]\nIndependence and modern Pakistan\nMain articles: Dominion of Pakistan and History of Pakistan\nSee also: Monarchy of Pakistan\nQueen Elizabeth II was the last monarch of independent Pakistan, before it became a republic in 1956.\nAfter independence in 1947, Jinnah, the President of the Muslim League, became the nation's first Governor-General as well as the first President-Speaker of the Parliament , but he died of tuberculosis on 11 September 1948. [87] Meanwhile, Pakistan's founding fathers agreed to appoint Liaquat Ali Khan , the secretary-general of the party , the nation's first\nPrime Minister . From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a monarchy within the Commonwealth of Nations, and had two monarchs before it became a republic. [88]\nThe creation of Pakistan was never fully accepted by many British leaders, among them Lord Mountbatten . [89] Mountbatten clearly expressed his lack of support and faith in the Muslim League's idea of Pakistan. [90] Jinnah refused Mountbatten's offer to serve as Governor-General of Pakistan . [91] When Mountbatten was asked by Collins and Lapierre if he would have sabotaged Pakistan had he known that Jinnah was dying of tuberculosis, he replied 'most probably'. [92]\nThe American CIA film on Pakistan, made in 1950, examines the history and geography of Pakistan.\n\"You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place or worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed – that has nothing to do with the business of the State.\"\n— Muhammad Ali Jinnah 's first speech to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan [93]\nMaulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani , a respected Deobandi alim (scholar) who occupied the position of Shaykh al-Islam in Pakistan in 1949, and Maulana Mawdudi of Jamaat-i-Islami played a pivotal role in the demand for an Islamic constitution. Mawdudi demanded that the Constituent Assembly make an explicit declaration affirming the \"supreme sovereignty of God\" and the supremacy of the shariah in Pakistan. [94]\nA significant result of the efforts of the Jamaat-i-Islami and the ulama was the passage of the Objectives Resolution in March 1949. The Objectives Resolution, which Liaquat Ali Khan called the second most important step in Pakistan's history, declared that \"sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to God Almighty alone and the authority which He has delegated to the State of Pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by Him is a sacred trust\". The Objectives Resolution has been incorporated as a preamble to the constitutions of 1956, 1962, and 1973. [95]\nDemocracy was stalled by the martial law that had been enforced by President Iskander Mirza , who was replaced by the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army , General Ayub Khan . After adopting a presidential system in 1962, the country experienced exceptional growth until a second war with India in 1965 that led to an economic downturn and wide-scale public disapproval in 1967. [96] [97]\nConsolidating control from Ayub Khan in 1969, President Yahya Khan had to deal with a devastating cyclone that caused 500,000 deaths in East Pakistan . [98]\nIn 1970 Pakistan held its first democratic elections since independence, meant to mark a transition from military rule to democracy, but after the East Pakistani Awami League won against the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Yahya Khan and the military establishment refused to hand over power. [99] [100]\nOperation Searchlight , a military crackdown on the Bengali nationalist movement, led to a declaration of independence and the waging of a war of liberation by the Bengali Mukti Bahini forces in East Pakistan, [100] [101] which in West Pakistan was described as a civil war as opposed to a war of liberation. [102]\nSigning of the Tashkent Declaration to end hostilities with India in 1965 in Tashkent , USSR , by President Ayub alongside Bhutto (centre) and Aziz Ahmed (left)\nIndependent researchers estimate that between 300,000 and 500,000 civilians died during this period while the Bangladesh government puts the number of dead at three million, [103] a figure that is now nearly universally regarded as excessively inflated. [104] Some academics such as Rudolph Rummel and Rounaq Jahan say both sides [105] committed genocide; others such as Richard Sisson and Leo E. Rose believe there was no genocide. [106] In response to India's support for the insurgency in East Pakistan, preemptive strikes on India by Pakistan's air force , navy , and marines sparked a conventional war in 1971 that resulted in an Indian victory and East Pakistan gaining independence as Bangladesh . [100]\nWith Pakistan surrendering in the war, Yahya Khan was replaced by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as president; the country worked towards promulgating its constitution and putting the country on the road to democracy. Democratic rule resumed from 1972 to 1977—an era of self-consciousness, intellectual leftism , nationalism , and nationwide reconstruction. [107] In 1972 Pakistan embarked on an ambitious plan to develop its nuclear deterrence capability with the goal of preventing any foreign invasion ; the country's first\nnuclear power plant was inaugurated in that same year. [108] [109] Accelerated in response to India's first nuclear test in 1974, this crash program was completed in 1979. [109]\nDemocracy ended with a military coup in 1977 against the leftist PPP, which saw General Zia-ul-Haq become the president in 1978. From 1977 to 1988, President Zia's corporatisation and economic Islamisation initiatives led to Pakistan becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in South Asia. [110] While building up the country's nuclear program , increasing Islamisation , [111] and the rise of a homegrown conservative philosophy, Pakistan helped subsidise and distribute US resources to factions of the mujahideen against the USSR 's intervention in communist Afghanistan . [112] Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province became a base for the anti-Soviet Afghan fighters, with the province's influential Deobandi ulama playing a significant role in encouraging and organising the 'jihad'. [113]\nPresident Zia died in a plane crash in 1988, and Benazir Bhutto , daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the country's first female Prime Minister. The PPP was followed by conservative Pakistan Muslim League (N) , and over the next decade the leaders of the two parties fought for power, alternating in office while the country's situation worsened; economic indicators fell sharply, in contrast to the 1980s. This period is marked by prolonged stagflation , instability, corruption , nationalism , geopolitical rivalry with India, and the clash of left wing - right wing ideologies. [114] As PML (N) secured a supermajority in elections in 1997, Nawaz Sharif authorised nuclear testings (See: Chagai-I and Chagai-II ), as a retaliation to the second nuclear tests ordered by India, led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in May 1998. [115]\nPresident George W. Bush meets with President Musharraf in Islamabad during his 2006 visit to Pakistan.\nMilitary tension between the two countries in the Kargil district led to the Kargil War of 1999, and turmoil in civic-military relations allowed General Pervez Musharraf to take over through a bloodless coup d'état . [116] [117] Musharraf governed Pakistan as chief executive from 1999 to 2001 and as President from 2001 to 2008—a period of enlightenment , social liberalism , extensive economic reforms , [118] and direct involvement in the US-led war on terrorism . When the National Assembly historically completed its first full five-year term on 15 November 2007, the new elections were called by the Election Commission . [119]\nAfter the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007, the PPP secured the most votes in the elections of 2008, appointing party member Yousaf Raza Gillani as Prime Minister. [120] Threatened with impeachment , President Musharraf resigned on 18 August 2008, and was succeeded by Asif Ali Zardari . [121] Clashes with the judicature prompted Gillani 's disqualification from the Parliament and as the Prime Minister in June 2012. [122] By its own financial calculations, Pakistan's involvement in the war on terrorism has cost up to $118 billion, [123]\nsixty thousand casualties and more than 1.8 million displaced civilians. [124] The general election held in 2013 saw the PML (N) almost achieve a supermajority , following which Nawaz Sharif was elected as the Prime Minister, returning to the post for the third time in fourteen years, in a democratic transition. [125] In 2018, Imran Khan (the chairman of PTI ) won the 2018 Pakistan general election with 116 general seats and became the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan in election of National Assembly of Pakistan for Prime Minister by getting 176 votes against Shehbaz Sharif (the chairman of PML (N) ) who got 96 votes. [126] In April 2022, Shehbaz Sharif was elected as Pakistan's new prime minister, after Imran Khan lost a no-confidence vote in the parliament. [127]\nRole of Islam\nSee also: Islam in Pakistan\nPakistan is the only country to have been created in the name of Islam. [128] The idea of Pakistan, which had received overwhelming popular support among Muslims, especially those in the provinces of British India where Muslims were in a minority such as the United Provinces , [129] was articulated in terms of an Islamic state by the Muslim League leadership, the ulama (Islamic clergy) and Jinnah. [130] Jinnah had developed a close association with the ulama and upon his death was described by one such alim , Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani , as the greatest Muslim after Aurangzeb and as someone who desired to unite the Muslims of the world under the banner of Islam. [131]\nThe Objectives Resolution in March 1949, which declared God as the sole sovereign over the entire universe, represented the first formal step to transform Pakistan into an Islamic state. [132] [95] Muslim League leader Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman asserted that Pakistan could only truly become an Islamic state after bringing all believers of Islam into a single political unit. [133] Keith Callard, one of the earliest scholars on Pakistani politics, observed that Pakistanis believed in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the Muslim world and assumed that Muslim from other countries would share their views on the relationship between religion and nationality. [134]\nEid Prayers at the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore\nHowever, Pakistan's pan-Islamist sentiments for a united Islamic bloc called Islamistan were not shared by other Muslim governments, [135] although Islamists such as the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Al-Haj Amin al-Husseini , and leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood , became drawn to the country. Pakistan's desire for an international organization of Muslim countries was fulfilled in the 1970s when the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) was formed. [136]\nThe strongest opposition to the Islamist ideological paradigm being imposed on the state came from the Bengali Muslims of East Pakistan [137] whose educated class, according to a survey by social scientist Nasim Ahmad Jawed, preferred secularism and focused on ethnic identity unlike educated West Pakistanis who tended to prefer an Islamic identity. [138] The Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami considered Pakistan to be an Islamic state and believed Bengali nationalism to be unacceptable. In the 1971 conflict over East Pakistan, the Jamaat-e-Islami fought the Bengali nationalists on the Pakistan Army's side. [139] The conflict concluded with East Pakistan seceding and the creation of independent Bangladesh .\nAfter Pakistan's first ever general elections, the 1973 Constitution was created by an elected Parliament. [140] The Constitution declared Pakistan an Islamic Republic and Islam as the state religion. It also stated that all laws would have to be brought into accordance with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah and that no law repugnant to such injunctions could be enacted. [141] The 1973 Constitution also created certain institutions such as the Shariat Court and the Council of Islamic Ideology to channel the interpretation and application of Islam. [142]\nPakistan's leftist Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto faced vigorous opposition which coalesced into a movement united under the revivalist banner of Nizam-e-Mustafa (\"Rule of the Prophet \") [143] which aimed to establish an Islamic state based on Sharia laws. Bhutto agreed to some Islamist demands before being overthrown in a coup. [144]\nIn 1977, after taking power from Bhutto in a coup d'état, General Zia-ul-Haq , who came from a religious background, [145] committed himself to establishing an Islamic state and enforcing sharia law. [144] Zia established separate Shariat judicial courts [146] and court benches [147] to judge legal cases using Islamic doctrine. [148] Zia bolstered the influence of the ulama (Islamic clergy) and the Islamic parties. [148]\nZia-ul-Haq forged a strong alliance between the military and Deobandi institutions [149] and even though most Barelvi ulama [150] and only a few Deobandi scholars had supported Pakistan's creation, Islamic state politics came to be mostly in favour of Deobandi (and later Ahl-e-Hadith/ Salafi ) institutions instead of Barelvi. [151] Sectarian tensions increased with Zia's anti-Shia policies. [152]\nAccording to a Pew Research Center (PEW) opinion poll, a majority of Pakistanis support making Sharia the official law of the land. [153] In a survey of several Muslim countries, PEW also found that Pakistanis tend to identify with their religion more than their nationality in contrast to Muslims in other nations such as Egypt , Indonesia and Jordan . [154]\nGeography, environment, and climate\nMain articles: Geography of Pakistan , Environment of Pakistan , Climate of Pakistan , Extreme weather records in Pakistan , List of tropical cyclones in Pakistan , and List of beaches in Pakistan\nKöppen climate classification of Pakistan\nThe geography and climate of Pakistan are extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife . [155] Pakistan covers an area of 881,913 km 2 (340,509 sq mi), approximately equal to the combined land areas of France and the United Kingdom. It is the 33rd-largest nation by total area , although this ranking varies depending on how the disputed territory of Kashmir is counted. Pakistan has a 1,046 km (650 mi) coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south [156] and land borders of 6,774 km (4,209 mi) in total: 2,430 km (1,510 mi) with Afghanistan, 523 km (325 mi) with China , 2,912 km (1,809 mi) with India and 909 km (565 mi) with Iran . [157] It shares a maritime border with Oman, [158] and is separated from Tajikistan by the cold, narrow Wakhan Corridor . [159] Pakistan occupies a geopolitically important location at the crossroads of South Asia, the Middle East, and Central Asia. [160]\nGeologically, Pakistan is located in the Indus–Tsangpo Suture Zone and overlaps the Indian tectonic plate in its Sindh and Punjab provinces; Balochistan and most of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are within the Eurasian plate , mainly on the Iranian plateau . Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir lie along the edge of the Indian plate and hence are prone to violent earthquakes . This region has the highest rates of seismicity and the largest earthquakes in the Himalaya region. [161] Ranging from the coastal areas of the south to the glaciated mountains of the north, Pakistan's landscapes vary from plains to deserts, forests, hills, and plateaus. [162]\nA satellite image showing the topography of Pakistan\nPakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands, the Indus River plain, and the Balochistan Plateau. [163] The northern highlands contain the Karakoram , Hindu Kush , and Pamir mountain ranges (see mountains of Pakistan ), which contain some of the world's highest peaks, including five of the fourteen eight-thousanders (mountain peaks over 8,000 metres or 26,250 feet), which attract adventurers and mountaineers from all over the world, notably K2 (8,611 m or 28,251 ft) and Nanga Parbat (8,126 m or 26,660 ft). [164] The Balochistan Plateau lies in the west and the Thar Desert in the east. The 1,609 km (1,000 mi) Indus River and its tributaries flow through the country from the Kashmir region to the Arabian Sea. There is an expanse of alluvial plains along it in the Punjab and Sindh. [165]\nThe climate varies from tropical to temperate, with arid conditions in the coastal south. There is a monsoon season with frequent flooding due to heavy rainfall, and a dry season with significantly less rainfall or none at all. There are four distinct seasons in Pakistan: a cool, dry winter from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. [71] Rainfall varies greatly from year to year, and patterns of alternate flooding and drought are common. [166]\nFlora and fauna\nMain articles: Wildlife of Pakistan , Flora of Pakistan , and Fauna of Pakistan\nThe diversity of the landscape and climate in Pakistan allows a wide variety of trees and plants to flourish. The forests range from coniferous alpine and subalpine trees such as spruce , pine , and deodar cedar in the extreme northern mountains to deciduous trees in most of the country (for example, the mulberry-like shisham found in the Sulaiman Mountains ), to palms such as coconut and date in the southern Punjab, southern Balochistan, and all of Sindh. The western hills are home to juniper , tamarisk , coarse grasses, and scrub plants. Mangrove forests form much of the coastal wetlands along the coast in the south. [167]\nMarkhor is the national animal of Pakistan. [168]\nConiferous forests are found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 4,000 metres (3,300 to 13,100 feet) in most of the northern and northwestern highlands. In the xeric regions of Balochistan, date palm and Ephedra are common. In most of the Punjab and Sindh, the Indus plains support tropical and subtropical dry and moist broadleaf forest as well as tropical and xeric shrublands. [169] About 2.2% or 1,687,000 hectares (16,870 km 2 ) of Pakistan was forested in 2010. [170]\nThe fauna of Pakistan also reflects the country's varied climate. Around 668 bird species are found there, [171] including crows , sparrows , mynas , hawks , falcons , and eagles . Palas, Kohistan , has a significant population of western tragopan . [172] Many birds sighted in Pakistan are migratory, coming from Europe, Central Asia, and India. [173]\nThe southern plains are home to mongooses , small Indian civet , hares, the Asiatic jackal , the Indian pangolin , the jungle cat , and the desert cat . There are mugger crocodiles in the Indus, and wild boar , deer, porcupines , and small rodents in the surrounding areas. The sandy scrublands of central Pakistan are home to Asiatic jackals, striped hyenas , wildcats, and leopards . [174] [175] The lack of vegetative cover, the severe climate, and the impact of grazing on the deserts have left wild animals in a precarious position. The chinkara is the only animal that can still be found in significant numbers in Cholistan . A small number of nilgai are found along the Pakistan–India border and in some parts of Cholistan. [174] [176] A wide variety of animals live in the mountainous north, including the Marco Polo sheep , the urial (a subspecies of wild sheep), the markhor goat, the ibex goat, the Asian black bear , and the Himalayan brown bear . [174] [177] [178] Among the rare animals found in the area are the snow leopard [177] and the blind Indus river dolphin , of which there are believed to be about 1,100 remaining, protected at the Indus River Dolphin Reserve in Sindh. [177] [179] In total, 174 mammals, 177 reptiles, 22 amphibians, 198 freshwater fish species and 5,000 species of invertebrates (including insects) have been recorded in Pakistan. [171]\nThe flora and fauna of Pakistan suffer from a number of problems. Pakistan has the second-highest rate of deforestation in the world, which, along with hunting and pollution, has had adverse effects on the ecosystem. It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.42/10, ranking it 41st globally out of 172 countries. [180] The government has established a large number of protected areas, wildlife sanctuaries, and game reserves to address these issues. [171]\nGovernment and politics\nMain articles: Government of Pakistan and Politics of Pakistan\nParliament House\nPakistan's political experience is essentially related to the struggle of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent to regain the power they lost to British colonisation. [181] Pakistan is a democratic parliamentary\nfederal republic , with Islam as the state religion . [7] The first constitution was adopted in 1956 but suspended by Ayub Khan in 1958, who replaced it with the second constitution in 1962. [74] A complete and comprehensive constitution was adopted in 1973, but it was suspended by Zia-ul-Haq in 1977 but reinstated in 1985. This constitution is the country's most important document, laying the foundations of the current government. [157] The Pakistani military establishment has played an influential role in mainstream politics throughout Pakistan's political history . [74] The periods 1958–1971, 1977–1988 , and 1999–2008 saw military coups that resulted in the imposition of martial law and military commanders who governed as de facto presidents. [182] Today Pakistan has a multi-party\nparliamentary system with clear division of powers and checks and balances among the branches of government. The first successful democratic transition occurred in May 2013. Politics in Pakistan is centred on, and dominated by, a homegrown social philosophy comprising a blend of ideas from socialism , conservatism , and the third way . As of the general elections held in 2013, the three main political parties in the country are: the centre-right\nconservative\nPakistan Muslim League-N ; the centre-left\nsocialist PPP; and the centrist and third-way Pakistan Movement for Justice (PTI). In 2010, constitutional changes reduced presidential powers and the role of the president became purely ceremonial. The role of prime minister strengthened. [183]\nHead of State : The President , who is elected by an Electoral College is the ceremonial head of the state and is the civilian commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Armed Forces (with the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee as principal military adviser), but military appointments and key confirmations in the armed forces are made by the Prime Minister after reviewing the reports on candidates' merit and performance. Almost all appointed officers in the judicature, military , the chairman joint chiefs , joint staff , and legislature require the executive confirmation from the Prime Minister, whom the President must consult by law. However, the powers to pardon and grant clemency lie with the President of Pakistan.\nLegislative : The bicameral legislature comprises a 104-member Senate ( upper house ) and a 342-member National Assembly ( lower house ). Members of the National Assembly are elected through the first-past-the-post system under universal adult suffrage , representing electoral districts known as National Assembly constituencies . According to the constitution, the 70 seats reserved for women and religious minorities are allocated to the political parties according to their proportional representation. Senate members are elected by provincial legislators, with all the provinces having equal representation.\nPrime Minister's Office\nExecutive: The Prime Minister is usually the leader of the majority rule party or a coalition in the National Assembly — the lower house . The Prime Minister serves as the head of government and is designated to exercise as the country's chief executive. The Prime Minister is responsible for appointing a cabinet consisting of ministers and advisers as well as running the government operations, taking and authorising executive decisions, appointments and recommendations of senior civil servants that require executive confirmation of the Prime Minister.\nProvincial governments : Each of the four provinces has a similar system of government , with a directly elected\nProvincial Assembly in which the leader of the largest party or coalition is elected Chief Minister . Chief Ministers oversee the provincial governments and head the provincial cabinet. It is common in Pakistan to have different ruling parties or coalitions in each of the provinces. The provincial bureaucracy is headed by the Chief Secretary , who is appointed by the Prime Minister. The provincial assemblies have power to make laws and approve the provincial budget which is commonly presented by the provincial finance minister every fiscal year. Provincial governors who are the ceremonial heads of the provinces are appointed by the President. [157]\nSupreme Court of Pakistan\nJudicature : The judiciary of Pakistan is a hierarchical system with two classes of courts: the superior (or higher) judiciary and the subordinate (or lower) judiciary. The Chief Justice of Pakistan is the chief judge who oversees the judicature's court system at all levels of command. The superior judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court of Pakistan , the Federal Shariat Court and five high courts , with the Supreme Court at the apex. The Constitution of Pakistan entrusts the superior judiciary with the obligation to preserve, protect and defend the constitution. Other regions of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan have separate court systems.\nForeign relations\nMain article: Foreign relations of Pakistan\nPresident of Pakistan Ayub Khan with US President John F. Kennedy in 1961\nSince Independence, Pakistan has attempted to balance its relations with foreign nations. [184] Pakistan is a strong ally of China, with both countries placing considerable importance on the maintenance of an extremely close and supportive special relationship . [185] It has also been a major non-NATO ally of the United States ever since the war against terrorism  – a status achieved in 2004. [186] Pakistan's foreign policy and geostrategy mainly focus on the economy and security against threats to its national identity and territorial integrity, and on the cultivation of close relations with other Muslim countries. [187]\nThe Kashmir conflict remains the major point of contention between Pakistan and India; three of their four wars were fought over this territory. [188] Due partly to difficulties in relations with its geopolitical rival India, Pakistan maintains close political relations with Turkey and Iran, [189] and both countries have been a focal point in Pakistan's foreign policy. [189] Saudi Arabia also maintains a respected position in Pakistan's foreign policy.\nA non-signatory party of the Treaty on Nuclear Non-Proliferation , Pakistan is an influential member of the IAEA . [190] In recent events, Pakistan has blocked an international treaty to limit fissile material , arguing that the \"treaty would target Pakistan specifically\". [191] In the 20th century, Pakistan's nuclear deterrence program focused on countering India's nuclear ambitions in the region , and nuclear tests by India eventually led Pakistan to reciprocate to maintain a geopolitical balance as becoming a nuclear power . [192] Currently, Pakistan maintains a policy of credible minimum deterrence , calling its program vital nuclear deterrence against foreign aggression. [193] [194]\nLocated in the strategic and geopolitical corridor of the world's major maritime oil supply lines and communication fibre optics, Pakistan has proximity to the natural resources of Central Asian countries. [195] Briefing on the country's foreign policy in 2004, a Pakistani senator [ clarification needed ] reportedly explained: \"Pakistan highlights sovereign equality of states, bilateralism, mutuality of interests, and non-interference in each other's domestic affairs as the cardinal features of its foreign policy.\" [196] Pakistan is an active member of the United Nations and has a Permanent Representative to represent Pakistan's positions in international politics. [197] Pakistan has lobbied for the concept of \" enlightened moderation \" in the Muslim world. [198] Pakistan is also a member of Commonwealth of Nations, [199] the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), [200] and the G20 developing nations . [201]\nPakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan at the 2019 Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit\nDue to ideological differences, Pakistan opposed the Soviet Union in the 1950s. During the Soviet–Afghan War in the 1980s, Pakistan was one of the closest allies of the United States. [196] [202] Relations between Pakistan and Russia have greatly improved since 1999, and co-operation in various sectors has increased. [203] Pakistan has had an \"on-and-off\" relationship with the United States. A close ally of the United States during the Cold War , Pakistan's relationship with the US soured in the 1990s when the latter imposed sanctions because of Pakistan's secretive nuclear development. [204] Since 9/11 , Pakistan has been a close ally of the US on the issue of counterterrorism in the regions of the Middle East and South Asia, with the US supporting Pakistan with aid money and weapons. [205] [206] Initially, the US-led war on terrorism led to an improvement in the relationship, but it was strained by a divergence of interests and resulting mistrust during the war in Afghanistan and by issues related to terrorism. [207] The Pakistani intelligence agency, the ISI , was accused of supporting Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan. [208] [209] [210]\nPakistan does not have diplomatic relations with Israel ; [211] nonetheless, some Israeli citizens have visited the country on tourist visas. [212] However, an exchange took place between the two countries using Turkey as a communication conduit. [213] Despite Pakistan being the only country in the world that has not established diplomatic relations with Armenia , an Armenian community still resides in Pakistan. [214] Pakistan had warm relations with Bangladesh, despite some initial strains in their relationship.\nRelations with China\nMain article: China–Pakistan relations\nPakistan Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai signing the Treaty of Friendship Between China and Pakistan. Pakistan is host to China's largest embassy. [215]\nPakistan was one of the first countries to establish formal diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China , and the relationship continues to be strong since China's war with India in 1962, forming a special relationship. [216] From the 1960s to 1980s, Pakistan greatly helped China in reaching out to the world's major countries and helped facilitate US President Richard Nixon 's state visit to China. [216] Despite the change of governments in Pakistan and fluctuations in the regional and global situation, China's policy in Pakistan continues to be a dominant factor at all times. [216] In return, China is Pakistan's largest trading partner, and economic co-operation has flourished, with substantial Chinese investment in Pakistan's infrastructural expansion such as the Pakistani deep-water port at Gwadar . Friendly Sino-Pakistani relations reached new heights as both countries signed 51 agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) in 2015 for co-operation in different areas. [217] Both countries signed a Free Trade Agreement in the 2000s, and Pakistan continues to serve as China's communication bridge to the Muslim world. [218] In 2016, China announced that it will set up an anti-terrorism alliance with Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. [219]\nEmphasis on relations with Muslim world\nAfter Independence, Pakistan vigorously pursued bilateral relations with other Muslim countries [220] and made an active bid for leadership of the Muslim world , or at least for leadership in efforts to achieve unity. [221] The Ali brothers had sought to project Pakistan as the natural leader of the Islamic world, in part due to its large manpower and military strength. [222] A top-ranking Muslim League leader, Khaliquzzaman , declared that Pakistan would bring together all Muslim countries into Islamistan  – a pan-Islamic entity. [223]\nSuch developments (along with Pakistan's creation) did not get American approval, and British Prime Minister Clement Attlee voiced international opinion at the time by stating that he wished that India and Pakistan would re-unite. [224] Since most of the Arab world was undergoing a nationalist awakening at the time, there was little attraction to Pakistan's Pan-Islamic aspirations. [225] Some of the Arab countries saw the 'Islamistan' project as a Pakistani attempt to dominate other Muslim states. [226]\nPakistan vigorously championed the right of self-determination for Muslims around the world. Pakistan's efforts for the independence movements of Indonesia, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco , and Eritrea were significant and initially led to close ties between these countries and Pakistan. [227] However, Pakistan also masterminded an attack on the Afghan city of Jalalabad during the Afghan Civil War to establish an Islamic government there. Pakistan had wished to foment an 'Islamic Revolution' that would transcend national borders, covering Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Central Asia. [228]\nOn the other hand, Pakistan's relations with Iran have been strained at times due to sectarian tensions. [229] Iran and Saudi Arabia used Pakistan as a battleground for their proxy sectarian war, and by the 1990s Pakistan's support for the Sunni Taliban organisation in Afghanistan became a problem for Shia Iran, which opposed a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. [230] Tensions between Iran and Pakistan intensified in 1998 when Iran accused Pakistan of war crimes after Pakistani warplanes had bombarded Afghanistan's last Shia stronghold in support of the Taliban. [231]\nPakistan is an influential and founding member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Maintaining cultural, political, social, and economic relations with the Arab world and other countries in the Muslim world is a vital factor in Pakistan's foreign policy. [232]\nAdministrative divisions\nMain article: Administrative units of Pakistan\nAdministrative division\nCapital\nPopulation\n  Balochistan\nQuetta\n12,344,408\n  Punjab\nLahore\n110,126,285\n  Sindh\nKarachi\n47,886,051\n  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\nPeshawar\n40,525,047\n  Gilgit-Baltistan\nGilgit\n1,800,000\n  Azad Kashmir\nMuzaffarabad\n4,567,982\nIslamabad Capital Territory\nIslamabad\n2,851,868\nA federal parliamentary republic state, Pakistan is a federation that comprises four provinces : Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan, [233] and three territories : Islamabad Capital Territory , Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir. The Government of Pakistan exercises the de facto jurisdiction over the Frontier Regions and the western parts of the Kashmir Regions , which are organised into the separate political entities Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan (formerly Northern Areas). In 2009, the constitutional assignment ( the Gilgit–Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order ) awarded the Gilgit-Baltistan a semi-provincial status , giving it self-government. [234]\nThe local government system consists of a three-tier system of districts , tehsils , and union councils , with an elected body at each tier. [235] There are about 130 districts altogether, of which Azad Kashmir has ten [236] and Gilgit-Baltistan seven. [237]\nClickable map of the four provinces and three federal territories of Pakistan.\nLaw enforcement is carried out by a joint network of the intelligence community with jurisdiction limited to the relevant province or territory. The National Intelligence Directorate coordinates the information intelligence at both federal and provincial levels; including the FIA , IB , Motorway Police , and Civil Armed Forces such as the Pakistan Rangers and the Frontier Corps . [238]\nPakistan's \"premier\" intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), was formed just within a year after the Independence of Pakistan in 1947. [239] ABC News Point in 2014 reported that the ISI was ranked as the top intelligence agency in the world [240] while Zee News reported the ISI as ranking fifth among the world's most powerful intelligence agencies. [241]\nThe court system is organised as a hierarchy, with the Supreme Court at the apex, below which are high courts, Federal Shariat Courts (one in each province and one in the federal capital), district courts (one in each district), Judicial Magistrate Courts (in every town and city), Executive Magistrate Courts, and civil courts. The Penal code has limited jurisdiction in the Tribal Areas, where law is largely derived from tribal customs. [238] [242]\nKashmir conflict\nMain article: Kashmir conflict\nThe areas shown in green are the Pakistani-controlled areas.\nKashmir , a Himalayan region situated at the northernmost point of the Indian subcontinent , was governed as an autonomous princely state known as Jammu and Kashmir in the British Raj prior to the Partition of India in August 1947. Following the independence of India and Pakistan post-partition, the region became the subject of a major territorial dispute that has hindered their bilateral relations . The two states have engaged each other in two large-scale wars over the region in 1947–1948 and 1965 . India and Pakistan have also fought smaller-scale protracted conflicts over the region in 1984 and 1999 . [188] Approximately 45.1% of the Kashmir region is controlled by India (administratively split into Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh ), which also claims the entire territory of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir that is not under its control. [188] India's control over Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as well as its claim to the rest of the region has likewise been contested by Pakistan, which controls approximately 38.2% of the region (administratively split into Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit−Baltistan ) and claims all of the territory under Indian control. [188] [243] Additionally, approximately 20% of the region has been controlled by China (known as Aksai Chin and the Shaksgam Valley ) since the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and the Sino-Pakistani Agreement of 1963 . [244] The Chinese-controlled areas of Kashmir remain subject to an Indian territorial claim, but are not claimed by Pakistan.\nNeelum Valley in Azad Kashmir is part of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir.\nIndia claims the entire Kashmir region on the basis of the Instrument of Accession —a legal agreement with the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir that was executed by Hari Singh , the maharaja of the state, who agreed to cede the entire area to newly-independent India. [245] Pakistan claims most of Kashmir on the basis of its Muslim -majority population and of its geography, the same principles that were applied for the creation of the two independent states. [246] India referred the dispute to the United Nations on 1 January 1948. [247] In a resolution passed in 1948, the UN's General Assembly asked Pakistan to remove most of its military troops to set the conditions for the holding of a plebiscite . However, Pakistan failed to vacate the region and a ceasefire was reached in 1949 establishing a ceasefire line known as the Line of Control (LoC) that divided Kashmir between the two states as a de facto border. [248] India, fearful that the Muslim-majority populace of Kashmir would vote to secede from India, did not allow a plebiscite to take place in the region. This was confirmed in a statement by India's Defense Minister, Krishna Menon , who stated: \"Kashmir would vote to join Pakistan and no Indian Government responsible for agreeing to plebiscite would survive.\" [249]\nPakistan claims that its position is for the right of the Kashmiri people to determine their future through impartial elections as mandated by the United Nations, [250] while India has stated that Kashmir is an \" integral part \" of India, referring to the 1972 Simla Agreement and to the fact that regional elections take place regularly. [251] In recent developments, certain Kashmiri independence groups believe that Kashmir should be independent of both India and Pakistan. [188]\nLaw enforcement\nMain articles: Law enforcement in Pakistan and Pakistani Intelligence Community\nThe law enforcement in Pakistan is carried out by joint network of several federal and provincial police agencies. The four provinces and the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) each have a civilian police force with jurisdiction extending only to the relevant province or territory. [157] At the federal level, there are a number of civilian intelligence agencies with nationwide jurisdictions including the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB), as well as National Guard and the Civil Armed Forces such as the Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts , the Punjab Rangers , and the Frontier Corps Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (North) .\nThe most senior officers of all the civilian police forces also form part of the Police Service , which is a component of the civil service of Pakistan. Namely, there is four provincial police service including the Punjab Police , Sindh Police , Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Police , and the Balochistan Police ; all headed by the appointed senior Inspector-Generals . The ICT has its own police component, the Capital Police , to maintain law and order in the capital. The CID bureaus are the crime investigation unit and form a vital part in each provincial police service .\nThe law enforcement in Pakistan also has a Motorway Patrol which is responsible for enforcement of traffic and safety laws, security and recovery on Pakistan's inter-provincial motorway network . In each of provincial Police Service , it also maintains a respective Elite Police units led by the NACTA —a counter-terrorism police unit as well as providing VIP escorts. In the Punjab and Sindh, the Pakistan Rangers are an internal security force with the prime objective to provide and maintain security in war zones and areas of conflict as well as maintaining law and order which includes providing assistance to the police. [252] The Frontier Corps serves the similar purpose in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa , and the Balochistan. [252]\nHuman rights\nMain articles: Human rights in Pakistan and LGBT rights in Pakistan\nMale homosexuality is illegal in Pakistan and punishable with up to life in prison. [253] In its 2018 Press Freedom Index , Reporters Without Borders ranked Pakistan number 139 out of 180 countries based on freedom of the press . [254] Television stations and newspapers are routinely shut down for publishing any reports critical of the government or the military. [255]\nMilitary\nMain article: Pakistan Armed Forces\nPakistan Air Force 's JF-17 Thunder flying in front of the 8,130-metre-high (26,660-foot), Nanga Parbat\nThe armed forces of Pakistan are the sixth largest in the world in terms of numbers in full-time service, with about 651,800 personnel on active duty and 291,000 paramilitary personnel, as of tentative estimates in 2021. [256] They came into existence after independence in 1947, and the military establishment has frequently influenced the national politics ever since. [182]\nChain of command of the military is kept under the control of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee ; all of the branches joint works, co-ordination, military logistics, and joint missions are under the Joint Staff HQ . [257] The Joint Staff HQ is composed of the Air HQ , Navy HQ , and Army GHQ in the vicinity of the Rawalpindi Military District . [258]\nThe Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee is the highest principle staff officer in the armed forces, and the chief military adviser to the civilian government though the chairman has no authority over the three branches of armed forces. [257] The Chairman joint chiefs controls the military from the JS HQ and maintains strategic communications between the military and the civilian government. [257] As of 2021 [update] , the CJCSC is General Nadeem Raza [259] alongside chief of army staff General Asim Munir , [260] [261]\nchief of naval staff\nAdmiral\nMuhammad Amjad Khan Niazi , [262] and chief of air staff\nAir Chief Marshal\nZaheer Ahmad Babar . [263] The main branches are the Army , the Air Force and the Navy , which are supported by a large number of paramilitaries in the country. [264] Control over the strategic arsenals , deployment, employment, development, military computers and command and control is a responsibility vested under the National Command Authority which oversaw the work on the nuclear policy as part of the credible minimum deterrence . [115]\nThe United States, Turkey, and China maintain close military relations and regularly export military equipment and technology transfer to Pakistan. [265] Joint logistics and major war games are occasionally carried out by the militaries of China and Turkey. [264] [266] Philosophical basis for the military draft is introduced by the Constitution in times of emergency, but it has never been imposed. [267]\nMilitary history\nSince 1947, Pakistan has been involved in four\nconventional wars with India. The first Indo-Pak war of 1947 occurred in Kashmir with Pakistan gaining control of Western Kashmir , (Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan), and India retaining Eastern Kashmir (Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh). Territorial problems eventually led to another conventional war in 1965. The 1971 war resulted in Pakistan's unconditional surrender of East Pakistan. [268] Tensions in Kargil brought the two countries at the another brink of war . [116] Since 1947 the unresolved territorial problems with Afghanistan saw border skirmishes which were kept mostly at the mountainous border . In 1961, the military and intelligence community repelled the Afghan incursion in the Bajaur Agency near the Durand Line border. [269]\nRising tensions with neighbouring USSR in their involvement in Afghanistan, Pakistani intelligence community , mostly the ISI , systematically coordinated the US resources to the Afghan mujahideen and foreign fighters against the Soviet Union's presence in the region. Military reports indicated that the PAF was in engagement with the Soviet Air Force , supported by the Afghan Air Force during the course of the conflict ; one of which belonged to Alexander Rutskoy . [270] Apart from its own conflicts, Pakistan has been an active participant in United Nations peacekeeping missions . It played a major role in rescuing trapped American soldiers from Mogadishu , Somalia, in 1993 in Operation Gothic Serpent . [271] [272] According to UN reports, the Pakistani military is the third largest troop contributor to UN peacekeeping missions after Ethiopia and India. [273]\nPakistan has deployed its military in some Arab countries , providing defence, training, and playing advisory roles. [274] The PAF and Navy 's fighter pilots have voluntarily served in Arab nations' militaries against Israel in the Six-Day War (1967) and in the Yom Kippur War (1973). Pakistan's fighter pilots shot down ten Israeli planes in the Six-Day War. [271] In the 1973 war, one of the PAF pilots, Flt. Lt. Sattar Alvi (flying a MiG-21), shot down an Israeli Air Force Mirage and was honoured by the Syrian government. [275] Requested by the Saudi monarchy in 1979, Pakistan's special forces units, operatives, and commandos were rushed to assist Saudi forces in Mecca to lead the operation of the Grand Mosque . For almost two weeks Saudi Special Forces and Pakistani commandos fought the insurgents who had occupied the Grand Mosque 's compound. [276] In 1991, Pakistan became involved with the Gulf War and sent 5,000 troops as part of a US-led coalition, specifically for the defence of Saudi Arabia . [277]\nDespite the UN arms embargo on Bosnia , General Javed Nasir of the ISI airlifted anti-tank weapons and missiles to Bosnian mujahideen which turned the tide in favour of Bosnian Muslims and forced the Serbs to lift the siege. Under Nasir's leadership the ISI was also involved in supporting Chinese Muslims in Xinjiang Province, rebel Muslim groups in the Philippines , and some religious groups in Central Asia. [278]\nSince 2004, the military has been engaged in an insurgency in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, mainly against the Tehrik-i-Taliban factions . [279] Major operations undertaken by the army include Operation Black Thunderstorm , Operation Rah-e-Nijat and Operation Zarb-e-Azb . [280]\nAccording to SIPRI , Pakistan was the 9th-largest recipient and importer of arms between 2012 and 2016. [281]\nEconomy\nThis section needs to be updated .

Economists estimate that Pakistan was part of the wealthiest region of the world throughout the first millennium CE, with the largest economy by GDP. This advantage was lost in the 18th century as other regions such as China and Western Europe edged forward. [289] Pakistan is considered a developing country [290] and is one of the Next Eleven , a group of eleven countries that, along with the BRICs , have a high potential to become the world's largest economies in the 21st century. [291] In recent years, after decades of social instability, as of 2013 [update] , serious deficiencies in macromanagement and unbalanced macroeconomics in basic services such as rail transportation and electrical energy generation have developed. [292] The economy is considered to be semi-industrialized, with centres of growth along the Indus River. [293] [294] [295] The diversified economies of Karachi and Punjab's urban centres coexist with less-developed areas in other parts of the country, particularly in Balochistan. [294] According to the Economic complexity index , Pakistan is the 67th-largest export economy in the world and the 106th-most complex economy. [296] During the fiscal year 2015–16, Pakistan's exports stood at US$20.81 billion and imports at US$44.76 billion, resulting in a negative trade balance of US$23.96 billion. [297]\nStatue of a bull outside the Pakistan Stock Exchange, Islamabad, Pakistan\nAs of 2022 [update] , Pakistan's estimated nominal GDP is US$376.493 billion. [298] The GDP by PPP is US$1.512 trillion. The estimated nominal per capita GDP is US$1,658, the GDP (PPP)/capita is US$6,662 ( international dollars ), [282] According to the World Bank , Pakistan has important strategic endowments and development potential. The increasing proportion of Pakistan's youth provides the country with both a potential demographic dividend and a challenge to provide adequate services and employment. [299] 21.04% of the population live below the international poverty line of US$1.25 a day. The unemployment rate among the aged 15 and over population is 5.5%. [300] Pakistan has an estimated 40 million middle class citizens, projected to increase to 100 million by 2050. [301] A 2015 report published by the World Bank ranked Pakistan's economy at 24th-largest [302] in the world by purchasing power and 41st-largest [303] in absolute terms. It is South Asia's second-largest economy, representing about 15.0% of regional GDP. [304]\nFiscal Year\nGDP growth [305]\nInflation rate [306]\n2013–14\n4.05%\n8.6%\n2014–15\n4.06%\n4.5%\n2015–16\n4.56%\n2.9%\n2016–17\n5.37%\n4.2%\n2017–18\n5.79%\n3.8%\nPakistan's economic growth since its inception has been varied. It has been slow during periods of democratic transition, but robust during the three periods of martial law , although the foundation for sustainable and equitable growth was not formed. [97] The early to middle 2000s was a period of rapid economic reforms ; the government raised development spending, which reduced poverty levels by 10% and increased GDP by 3%. [157] [307] The economy cooled again from 2007. [157] Inflation reached 25.0% in 2008, [308] and Pakistan had to depend on a fiscal policy backed by the International Monetary Fund to avoid possible bankruptcy. [309] A year later, the Asian Development Bank reported that Pakistan's economic crisis was easing. [310] The inflation rate for the fiscal year 2010–11 was 14.1%. [311] Since 2013, as part of an International Monetary Fund program, Pakistan's economic growth has picked up. In 2014 Goldman Sachs predicted that Pakistan's economy would grow 15 times in the next 35 years to become the 18th-largest economy in the world by 2050. [312] In his 2016 book, The Rise and Fall of Nations , Ruchir Sharma termed Pakistan's economy as at a 'take-off' stage and the future outlook until 2020 has been termed 'Very Good'. Sharma termed it possible to transform Pakistan from a \"low-income to a middle-income country during the next five years\".

The 7-million–strong Pakistani diaspora contributed US$19.9 billion to the economy in 2015–16. [315] [316] [317] The major source countries of remittances to Pakistan are: the UAE ; the United States; Saudi Arabia; the Gulf states (Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman); Australia; Canada; Japan; the United Kingdom; Norway; and Switzerland. [318] [319] According to the World Trade Organization , Pakistan's share of overall world exports is declining; it contributed only 0.13% in 2007. [320]\nAgriculture and primary sector\nMain articles: Agriculture in Pakistan , Fuel extraction in Pakistan , and Mining in Pakistan\nSurface mining in Sindh . Pakistan has been termed the 'Saudi Arabia of Coal' by Forbes . [321]\nThe structure of the Pakistani economy has changed from a mainly agricultural to a strong service base. Agriculture as of 2015 [update] accounts for only 20.9% of the GDP. [322] Even so, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization , Pakistan produced 21,591,400 metric tons of wheat in 2005, more than all of Africa (20,304,585 metric tons) and nearly as much as all of South America (24,557,784 metric tons). [323] Majority of the population, directly or indirectly, is dependent on this sector. It accounts for 43.5% of employed labour force and is the largest source of foreign exchange earnings. [322] [324]\nA large portion of the country's manufactured exports is dependent on raw materials such as cotton and hides that are part of the agriculture sector, while supply shortages and market disruptions in farm products do push up inflationary pressures. The country is also the fifth-largest producer of cotton, with cotton production of 14 million bales from a modest beginning of 1.7 million bales in the early 1950s; is self-sufficient in sugarcane; and is the fourth-largest producer in the world of milk. Land and water resources have not risen proportionately, but the increases have taken place mainly due to gains in labour and agriculture productivity. The major breakthrough in crop production took place in the late 1960s and 1970s due to the Green Revolution that made a significant contribution to land and yield increases of wheat and rice. Private tube wells led to a 50 percent increase in the cropping intensity which was augmented by tractor cultivation. While the tube wells raised crop yields by 50 percent, the High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) of wheat and rice led to a 50–60 percent higher yield. [325] Meat industry accounts for 1.4 percent of overall GDP. [326]\nIndustry\nMain article: Industry of Pakistan\nSee also: Textile industry in Pakistan\nTelevision assembly factory in Lahore . Pakistan's industrial sector accounts for about 20.3% of the GDP, and is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises . [327]\nIndustry is the second-largest sector of the economy, accounting for 19.74% of gross domestic product (GDP), and 24 percent of total employment. Large-scale manufacturing (LSM), at 12.2% of GDP, dominates the overall sector, accounting for 66% of the sectoral share, followed by small-scale manufacturing, which accounts for 4.9% of total GDP. Pakistan's cement industry is also fast growing mainly because of demand from Afghanistan and from the domestic real estate sector. In 2013 Pakistan exported 7,708,557 metric tons of cement. [328] Pakistan has an installed capacity of 44,768,250 metric tons of cement and 42,636,428 metric tons of clinker. In 2012 and 2013, the cement industry in Pakistan became the most profitable sector of the economy. [329]\nThe textile industry has a pivotal position in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan. In Asia, Pakistan is the eighth-largest exporter of textile products, contributing 9.5% to the GDP and providing employment to around 15 million people (some 30% of the 49 million people in the workforce). Pakistan is the fourth-largest producer of cotton with the third-largest spinning capacity in Asia after China and India, contributing 5% to the global spinning capacity. [330] China is the second largest buyer of Pakistani textiles, importing US$1.527 billion of textiles last fiscal. Unlike the US, where mostly value-added textiles are imported, China buys only cotton yarn and cotton fabric from Pakistan. In 2012, Pakistani textile products accounted for 3.3% or US$1.07bn of all UK textile imports, 12.4% or $4.61bn of total Chinese textile imports, 3.0% of all US textile imports ($2,980 million), 1.6% of total German textile imports ($880 million) and 0.7% of total Indian textile imports ($888 million). [331]\nServices\nMain articles: Real estate in Pakistan , Information technology in Pakistan , and Banking in Pakistan\nRising skyline of Karachi , with several under construction skyscrapers\nAs of 2014–15, the services sector makes up 58.8% of GDP [322] and has emerged as the main driver of economic growth. [332] Pakistani society like other developing countries is a consumption oriented society, having a high marginal propensity to consume. The growth rate of services sector is higher than the growth rate of agriculture and industrial sector. Services sector accounts for 54 percent of GDP in 2014 and little over one-third of total employment. Services sector has strong linkages with other sectors of economy; it provides essential inputs to agriculture sector and manufacturing sector. [333] Pakistan's I.T sector is regarded as among the fastest growing sector's in Pakistan. The World Economic Forum , assessing the development of Information and Communication Technology in the country ranked Pakistan 110th among 139 countries on the 'Networked Readiness Index 2016'. [334]\nAs of May 2020 [update] , Pakistan has about 82 million internet users, making it the 9th-largest population of Internet users in the world. [335] [336] The current growth rate and employment trend indicate that Pakistan's Information Communication Technology (ICT) industry will exceed the $10-billion mark by 2020. [337] The sector employees 12,000 and count's among top five freelancing nations. [338] The country has also improved its export performance in telecom, computer and information services, as the share of their exports surged from 8.2pc in 2005–06 to 12.6pc in 2012–13. This growth is much better than that of China, whose share in services exports was 3pc and 7.7pc for the same period, respectively. [339]\nTourism\nMain article: Tourism in Pakistan\nLake Saiful Muluk , located at the northern end of the Kaghan Valley , near the town of Naran , in the Saiful Muluk National Park\nThe 7,788-metre-tall (25,551 ft) Rakaposhi mountain towers over Hunza Valley\nWith its diverse cultures, people, and landscapes, Pakistan attracted around 6.6 million foreign tourists in 2018, [340] which represented a significant decline since the 1970s when the country received unprecedented numbers of foreign tourists due to the popular Hippie trail . The trail attracted thousands of Europeans and Americans in the 1960s and 1970s who travelled via land through Turkey and Iran into India through Pakistan. [341]\nNorthern Pakistan is well-known for its scenic beauty and several highest peaks of the world. The main destinations of choice for these tourists were the Khyber Pass , Peshawar , Karachi , Lahore , Swat and Rawalpindi . [342] The numbers following the trail declined after the Iranian Revolution and the Soviet–Afghan War . [343]\nPakistan's tourist attractions range from the mangroves in the south to the Himalayan hill stations in the north-east. The country's tourist destinations range from the Buddhist ruins of Takht-i-Bahi and Taxila , to the 5,000-year-old cities of the Indus Valley civilization such as Mohenjo-daro and Harappa . [344] Pakistan is home to several mountain peaks over 7,000 metres (23,000 feet). [345] The northern part of Pakistan has many old fortresses, examples of ancient architecture, and the Hunza and Chitral valleys, home to the small pre-Islamic Kalasha community claiming descent from Alexander the Great. [346] Pakistan's cultural capital, Lahore, contains many examples of Mughal architecture such as the Badshahi Masjid , the Shalimar Gardens , the Tomb of Jahangir , and the Lahore Fort .\nIn October 2006, just one year after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake , The Guardian released what it described as \"The top five tourist sites in Pakistan\" in order to help the country's tourism industry. [347] The five sites included Taxila , Lahore , the Karakoram Highway , Karimabad , and Lake Saiful Muluk . To promote Pakistan's unique cultural heritage, the government organises various festivals throughout the year. [348] In 2015, the World Economic Forum 's Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report ranked Pakistan 125 out of 141 countries. [349]\nInfrastructure\nSee also: Water supply and sanitation in Pakistan\nPakistan was recognised as the best country for infrastructure development in South Asia during the IWF and World Bank annual meetings in 2016. [350]\nNuclear power and energy\nMain articles: Nuclear power in Pakistan , Energy in Pakistan , and Electricity sector in Pakistan\nTarbela Dam , the largest earth filled dam in the world, was constructed in 1968.\nAs of May 2021, nuclear power is provided by six licensed commercial nuclear power plants . [351] The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) is solely responsible for operating these power plants, while the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority regulates safe usage of the nuclear energy. [352] The electricity generated by commercial nuclear power plants constitutes roughly 5.8% of Pakistan's electrical energy, compared to 64.2% from fossil fuels ( crude oil and natural gas), 29.9% from hydroelectric power , and 0.1% from coal . [353] [354] Pakistan is one of the four nuclear armed states (along with India, Israel, and North Korea ) that is not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , but it is a member in good standing of the International Atomic Energy Agency . [355]\nThe KANUPP-I , a Candu-type nuclear reactor, was supplied by Canada in 1971—the country's first commercial nuclear power plant . The Sino-Pakistani nuclear cooperation began in the early 1980s. After a Sino-Pakistani nuclear cooperation agreement in 1986, [356] China provided Pakistan with a nuclear reactor dubbed CHASNUPP-I for energy and the industrial growth of the country. In 2005 both countries proposed working on a joint energy security plan, calling for a huge increase in generation capacity to more than 160,000  MWe by 2030. Under its Nuclear Energy Vision 2050, the Pakistani government plans to increase nuclear power generation capacity to 40,000  MWe , [357] 8,900  MWe of it by 2030. [358]\nPakistan produced 1,135 megawatts of renewable energy for the month of October 2016. Pakistan expects to produce 10,000 megawatts of renewable energy by 2025. [359]\nIn June 2008 the nuclear commercial complex was expanded with the ground work of installing and operationalising the Chashma-III and Chashma–IV reactors at Chashma , Punjab Province , each with 325–340 MWe and costing ₨ 129 billion; from which the ₨ 80 billion came from international sources, principally China. A further agreement for China's help with the project was signed in October 2008, and given prominence as a counter to the US–India agreement that shortly preceded it. The cost quoted then was US$1.7 billion, with a foreign loan component of US$1.07 billion. In 2013 Pakistan established a second commercial nuclear complex in Karachi with plans of additional reactors, similar to the one in Chashma . [360] The electrical energy is generated by various energy corporations and evenly distributed by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) among the four provinces . However, the Karachi -based K-Electric and the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) generates much of the electrical energy used in Pakistan in addition to gathering revenue nationwide. [361] In 2014, Pakistan had an installed electricity generation capacity of ~22,797 MWt . [353]\nTransport\nMain article: Transport in Pakistan\nThe transport industry accounts for ~10.5% of the nation's GDP. [362]\nMotorways\nMain article: Motorways of Pakistan\nThe motorway passes through the Salt Range mountains.\nMotorways of Pakistan are a network of multiple-lane, high-speed, controlled-access highways in Pakistan, which are owned, maintained, and operated federally by Pakistan's National Highway Authority . As of 20 February 2020, 1882 km of motorways are operational, while an additional 1854 km are under construction or planned. All motorways in Pakistan are pre-fixed with the letter 'M' (for \"Motorway\") followed by the unique numerical designation of the specific highway (with a hyphen in the middle), e.g. \"M-1\". [363]\nPakistan's motorways are an important part of Pakistan's \"National Trade Corridor Project\", [364] which aims to link Pakistan's three Arabian Sea ports ( Karachi Port , Port Bin Qasim and Gwadar Port ) to the rest of the country through its national highways and motorways network and further north with Afghanistan , Central Asia and China. The project was planned in 1990. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor project aims to link Gwadar Port and Kashgar (China) using Pakistani motorways, national highways , and expressways .\nHighways\nSee also: National Highways of Pakistan\nHighways form the backbone of Pakistan's transport system; a total road length of 263,942 kilometres (164,006 miles) accounts for 92% of passengers and 96% of inland freight traffic. Road transport services are largely in the hands of the private sector . The National Highway Authority is responsible for the maintenance of national highways and motorways. The highway and motorway system depends mainly on north–south links connecting the southern ports to the populous provinces of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa . Although this network only accounts for 4.6% of total road length, [322] it carries 85% of the country's traffic. [365] [366]\nRailways\nSee also: List of railway stations in Pakistan\nKarachi Cantonment railway station\nThe Pakistan Railways , under the Ministry of Railways (MoR), operates the railroad system. From 1947 until the 1970s the train system was the primary means of transport until the nationwide constructions of the national highways and the economic boom of the automotive industry . Beginning in the 1990s there was a marked shift in traffic from rail to highways; dependence grew on roads after the introduction of vehicles in the country. Now the railway's share of inland traffic is below 8% for passengers and 4% for freight traffic. [322] As personal transportation began to be dominated by the automobile, total rail track decreased from 8,775 kilometres (5,453 miles) in 1990–91 to 7,791 kilometres (4,841 miles) in 2011. [365] [367] Pakistan expects to use the rail service to boost foreign trade with China, Iran, and Turkey. [368]\nAirports\nMain article: List of airports in Pakistan\nBoeing 737 owned and operated by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) at Skardu International Airport\nThere are an estimated 151 airports and airfields in Pakistan as of 2013—including both the military and the mostly publicly owned civilian airports. [369] Although Jinnah International Airport is the principal international gateway to Pakistan, the international airports in Lahore , Islamabad , Peshawar , Quetta , Faisalabad , Sialkot , and Multan also handle significant amounts of traffic.\nThe civil aviation industry is mixed with public and private sectors, which was deregulated in 1993. While the state-owned\nPakistan International Airlines (PIA) is the major and dominant air carrier that carries about 73% of domestic passengers and all domestic freight, the private airlines such as airBlue and Air Indus , also provide similar services at a low cost .\nSeaports\nPort of Karachi is one of South Asia 's largest and busiest deep-water seaports , handling about 60% of the nation's cargo (25 million tons per annum).\nMajor seaports are in Karachi , Sindh (the Karachi port , Port Qasim ). [365] [367] Since the 1990s some seaport operations have been moved to Balochistan with the construction of Gwadar Port , Port of Pasni and Gadani Port . [365] [367]\nGwadar Port is the deepest sea port of the world. [370] According to the WEF's Global Competitiveness Report, quality ratings of Pakistan's port infrastructure increased from 3.7 to 4.1 between 2007 and 2016. [371]\nMetro\nMain article: List of rapid transit systems in Pakistan\nMetro Train\nTrack of Islamabad-Rawalpindi Metrobus with adjoining station\nThe Orange Line Metro Train is an automated rapid transit system in Lahore . [372] The Orange line is the first of the three proposed rail lines part for the Lahore Metro . The line spans 27.1 km (16.8 mi) with 25.4 km (15.8 mi) elevated and 1.72 km (1.1 mi) underground and has a cost of 251.06 billion Rupees ($1.6 billion). [373] The line consists of 26 subway stations and is designed to carry over 250,000 passengers daily. The line became operational on 25 October 2020. [374]\nMetro Bus and BRTs\nLahore Metrobus is a bus rapid transit service operating in the city of Lahore . [375] The Metrobus network's first phase was opened in February 2013. It was the first Metro bus system in Pakistan.\nRawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus is a 48.1 km (29.9 mi) bus rapid transit system operating in the Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area . The Metrobus network's first phase was opened on 4 June 2015, and stretches 22.5 kilometres between Pak Secretariat , in Islamabad , and Saddar in Rawalpindi . The second stage stretches 25.6 kilometres between the Peshawar Morr Interchange and New Islamabad International Airport and was inaugurated on 18 April 2022. [376] [377] The system uses e-ticketing and an Intelligent Transportation System and is managed by the Punjab Mass Transit Authority .\nMultan Metrobus is a bus rapid transit (BRT) system in Multan . [378] Construction on the line began in May 2015, while operations commenced on 24 January 2017. [379]\nPeshawar Bus Rapid Transit (Peshawar BRT) is a bus rapid transit system in Peshawar , capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The construction of the project was started in October 2017 and was inaugurated on 13 August 2020, it is the fourth BRT system in Pakistan.\nGreen Line Metrobus is the first phase of Karachi Metrobus that has been operational since 25 December 2021. [380] The Government of Pakistan financed the majority of the project. [381] Construction of the Green Line began on 26 February 2016. [382]\nFaisalabad shuttle train service and Faisalabad Metrobus are the proposed rapid transit projects in the city of Faisalabad . These projects are the part of a mega-project of China–Pakistan Economic Corridor . [383]\nOther Systems\nKarachi Circular Railway is a partially active regional public transit system in Karachi, which serves the Karachi metropolitan area . KCR was fully operational between 1969 and 1999. Since 2001, restoration of the railway and restarting the system had been sought. [384] In November 2020, the KCR partially revived operations. [385]\nA tramway service was started in 1884 in Karachi but was closed in 1975 due to various factors. [386] The Sindh Government is planning to restart the tramway services in the city, collaborating with Austrian experts. [387]\nIn October 2019, a project for the construction of tramway service in Lahore has also been signed by the Punjab Government . This project will be launched under public-private partnership in a joint venture of European and Chinese companies along with the Punjab transport department. [388]\nFlyovers and underpasses\nMain article: List of flyovers in Pakistan\nNagan Chowrangi Flyover, Karachi\nMany flyovers and underpasses are located in major urban areas of the country to segregate the flow of traffic. The highest number of flyovers and under passes are located in Karachi , followed by Lahore . [389] Other cities having flyovers and underpasses for the regulation of flow of traffic includes Islamabad-Rawalpindi , Faisalabad , Gujranwala , Multan , Peshawar , Hyderabad , Quetta , Sargodha , Bahawalpur , Sukkur , Larkana , Rahim Yar Khan and Sahiwal etc. [390]\nBeijing Underpass, Lahore is the longest underpass of Pakistan with a length of about 1.3 km (0.81 mi). [391]\nMuslim Town Flyover , Lahore is the longest flyover of the country with a length of about 2.6 km (1.6 mi). [392]\nScience and technology\nMain articles: Science and technology in Pakistan and List of Pakistani inventions and discoveries\nAbdus Salam won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for his contribution to electroweak interaction . He was the first Muslim to win a Nobel prize in science.\nAtta-ur-Rahman won the UNESCO Science Prize for pioneering contributions in chemistry in 1999, the first Muslim to win it.\nDevelopments in science and technology have played an important role in Pakistan's infrastructure and helped the country connect to the rest of the world. [393] Every year, scientists from around the world are invited by the Pakistan Academy of Sciences and the Pakistan Government to participate in the International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics . [394] Pakistan hosted an international seminar on \"Physics in Developing Countries\" for the International Year of Physics 2005. [395] The Pakistani theoretical physicist Abdus Salam won a Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the electroweak interaction . [396] Influential publications and critical scientific work in the advancement of mathematics , biology , economics, computer science , and genetics have been produced by Pakistani scientists at both the domestic and international levels. [397]\nIn chemistry , Salimuzzaman Siddiqui was the first Pakistani scientist to bring the therapeutic constituents of the neem tree to the attention of natural products chemists. [398] Pakistani neurosurgeon Ayub Ommaya invented the Ommaya reservoir , a system for treatment of brain tumours and other brain conditions. [399] Scientific research and development play a pivotal role in Pakistani universities , government- sponsored national laboratories, science parks , and the industry . [400]\nAbdul Qadeer Khan , regarded as the founder of the HEU -based gas-centrifuge\nuranium enrichment program for Pakistan's integrated atomic bomb project . [401] He founded and established the Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL) in 1976, serving as both its senior scientist and the Director-General until his retirement in 2001, and he was an early and vital figure in other science projects . Apart from participating in Pakistan's atomic bomb project, he made major contributions in molecular morphology , physical martensite , and its integrated applications in condensed and material physics . [402]\nIn 2010 Pakistan was ranked 43rd in the world in terms of published scientific papers. [403] The Pakistan Academy of Sciences , a strong scientific community, plays an influential and vital role in formulating recommendations regarding science policies for the government. [404] Pakistan was ranked 99th in the Global Innovation Index in 2021, up from 107th in 2020. [405] [406] [407] [408] [409]\nThe 1960s saw the emergence of an active space program led by SUPARCO that produced advances in domestic rocketry , electronics , and aeronomy . The space program recorded a few notable feats and achievements. The successful launch of its first rocket into space made Pakistan the first South Asian country to have achieved such a task. [410] Successfully producing and launching the nation's first space satellite in 1990, Pakistan became the first Muslim country and second South Asian country to put a satellite into space. [411]\nPakistan witnessed a fourfold increase in its scientific productivity in the past decade surging from approximately 2,000 articles per year in 2006 to more than 9,000 articles in 2015. Making Pakistan's cited article's higher than the BRIC countries put together.\n— Thomson Reuters 's Another BRIC in the Wall 2016 report [412]\nAs an aftermath of the 1971 war with India , the clandestine crash program developed atomic weapons partly motivated by fear and to prevent any foreign intervention , while ushering in the atomic age in the post cold war era . [193] Competition with India and tensions eventually led to Pakistan's decision to conduct underground\nnuclear tests in 1998, thus becoming the seventh country in the world to successfully develop nuclear weapons . [413]\nPakistan is the first and only Muslim country that maintains an active research presence in Antarctica. [414] Since 1991 Pakistan has maintained two summer research stations and one weather observatory on the continent and plans to open another full-fledged permanent base in Antarctica. [415]\nEnergy consumption by computers and usage has grown since the 1990s when PCs were introduced; Pakistan has about 82 million Internet users and is ranked as one of the top countries that have registered a high growth rate in Internet penetration as of 2020 [update] . [335] Key publications have been produced by Pakistan, and domestic software development has gained considerable international praise. [416]\nAs of May 2020, Pakistan has about 82 million internet users, making it the 9th-largest population of Internet users in the world. [335] [336] Since the 2000s Pakistan has made a significant amount of progress in supercomputing , and various institutions offer research opportunities in parallel computing . The Pakistan government reportedly spends ₨ 4.6 billion on information technology projects, with emphasis on e-government , human resources, and infrastructure development. [417]\nEducation\nMain articles: Education in Pakistan , Higher Education Commission (Pakistan) , and Rankings of universities in Pakistan\nThe constitution of Pakistan requires the state to provide free primary and secondary education. [418]\nNUST in Islamabad is a top ranked Engineering University.\nAt the time of the establishment of Pakistan as a state, the country had only one university, Punjab University in Lahore . [ citation needed ] Very soon the Pakistan government established public universities in each of the four provinces , including Sindh University (1949), Peshawar University (1950), Karachi University (1953), and Balochistan University (1970). Pakistan has a large network of both public and private universities, which includes collaboration between the universities aimed at providing research and higher education opportunities in the country, although there is concern about the low quality of teaching in many of the newer schools. [419] It is estimated that there are 3,193 technical and vocational institutions in Pakistan, [420] and there are also madrassahs that provide free Islamic education and offer free board and lodging to students, who come mainly from the poorer strata of society. [421] Strong public pressure and popular criticism over extremists ' usage of madrassahs for recruitment, the Pakistan government has made repeated efforts to regulate and monitor the quality of education in the madrassahs . [422]\nLiteracy rate in Pakistan 1951–2018\nEducation in Pakistan is divided into six main levels: nursery (preparatory classes); primary (grades one through five); middle (grades six through eight); matriculation (grades nine and ten, leading to the secondary certificate ); intermediate (grades eleven and twelve, leading to a higher secondary certificate ); and university programmes leading to graduate and postgraduate degrees. [420] There is a network of private schools that constitutes a parallel secondary education system based on a curriculum set and administered by the Cambridge International Examinations of the United Kingdom. Some students choose to take the O-level and A level exams conducted by the British Council . [423] According to the International Schools Consultancy, Pakistan has 439 international schools. [424]\nMalala Yousafzai at the Women of the World Festival in 2014\nAs a result of initiatives taken in 2007, the English medium education has been made compulsory in all schools across the country. [425] In 2012, Malala Yousafzai , a campaigner for female education , was shot by a Taliban gunman in retaliation for her activism. [426] Yousafzai went on to become the youngest ever Nobel laureate for her global education-related advocacy. [427] Additional reforms enacted in 2013 required all educational institutions in Sindh to begin offering Chinese language courses, reflecting China's growing role as a superpower and its increasing influence in Pakistan. [428] The literacy rate of the population is 62.3% as of 2018. The rate of male literacy is 72.5% while the rate of female literacy is 51.8%. [429] Literacy rates vary by region and particularly by sex; as one example, in tribal areas female literacy is 9.5%, [430] while Azad Jammu & Kashmir has a literacy rate of 74%. [431] With the advent of computer literacy in 1995, the government launched a nationwide initiative in 1998 with the aim of eradicating illiteracy and providing a basic education to all children. [432] Through various educational reforms, by 2015 the Ministry of Education expected to attain 100% enrollment levels among children of primary school age and a literacy rate of ~86% among people aged over 10. [433] Pakistan is currently spending 2.3 percent of its GDP on education; [434] which according to the Institute of Social and Policy Sciences is one of the lowest in South Asia. [435]\nDemographics\nMain articles: Demographics of Pakistan and Demographic history of Pakistan\nFurther information: Overseas Pakistani\nPopulation Density per square kilometre of each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\nPopulation of each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\nThis section is an excerpt from Demographics of Pakistan . [ edit ]\nPakistan had a population of 213,222,917 according to the final results of the 2017 Census of Pakistan . [436] [437] [438] This figure includes Pakistan's four provinces , Islamabad Capital Territory , Azad Kashmir , and Gilgit-Baltistan . Pakistan is the world's fifth-most populated country . [439]\nBetween 1951 and 2017, Pakistan's population expanded over sixfold, going from 33.7 million to 207.7 million. The country has a relatively high, although declining, growth rate supported by high birth rates and low death rates. Between 1998 and 2017, the average annual population growth rate stood at +2.40%.\nDramatic social changes have led to urbanisation and the emergence of two megacities : Karachi and Lahore . The country's urban population more than tripled between 1981 and 2017 (from 23.8 million to 75.7 million), as Pakistan's urbanisation rate rose from 28.2% to 36.4%. Even with this, the nation's urbanisation rate remains one of the lowest in the world , and in 2017, over 130 million Pakistanis (making up nearly 65% of the population) lived in rural areas .\nDue to a high fertility rate , estimated at 3.5 in 2022, Pakistan has one of the world's youngest populations . The 2017 census recorded that 40.3% of the country's population was under the age of 15, while only 3.7% of Pakistanis were aged 65 or more. [440] The median age of the country was 19, [440] while its sex ratio was recorded to be 105 males per 100 females. [436]\nThe demographic history of Pakistan from the ancient Indus Valley civilisation to the modern era includes the arrival and settlement of many cultures and ethnic groups in the modern region of Pakistan from Eurasia and the nearby Middle East . Because of this, Pakistan has a multicultural, multilinguistic, and multiethnic society. Despite Urdu being Pakistan's lingua franca , estimates on how many languages are spoken in the country range from 75 to 85, [441] [442] and in 2017, the country's three largest ethnolinguistic groups were the Punjabis (making up 38.8% of the total population), the Pashtuns (18.2%), and the Sindhis (14.6%). [443] Pakistan is also thought to have the world's fourth-largest refugee population , estimated at 1.4 million in mid-2021 by the UNHCR . [444]\nEthnicity and languages\nMain articles: Languages of Pakistan and Ethnic groups in Pakistan\nSee also: Pakistanis\nDominant Ethnolinguistic Group in each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census [6]\nPakistan is a multicultural, multi-linguistic, and multiethnic society. Despite Urdu being Pakistan's lingua franca , estimates on how many languages are spoken in the country range from 75 to 85, [445] [446] Urdu—the lingua franca and a symbol of Muslim identity and national unity—is the national language and understood by over 75% of Pakistanis. It is the main medium of communication in the country, but the primary language of only 7% of the population. [447] [448] Urdu and English are the official languages of Pakistan. English is primarily used in official business and government, and in legal contracts; [157] the local variety is known as Pakistani English . The enforcement of Urdu to the exclusion of other majority languages has been criticised; in particular, the expulsion of Pashto from the institutional domains and deprivation of state patronage has been shown to create conditions in which Pashtuns are placed at social, cultural, and economic disadvantage. [449]\nAccording to the 2017 national census of Pakistan , the country's largest ethnolinguistic groups were the Punjabis (making up 38.8% of the total population), the Pashtuns (18.2%), Sindhis (14.6%), Saraikis (12.19%), Muhajirs (7.08%), and the Balochs (3.02%). [450] [451] The remaining population consist of a number of ethnic minorities such as the Brahuis , [452] [453] the Hindkowans , the various peoples of Gilgit-Baltistan, the Kashmiris, the Sheedis (who are of African descent), [454] and the Hazaras . [455] There are also scattered speakers of Gujarati in Karachi. [456]\nThere is also a large Pakistani diaspora worldwide, numbering over seven million, [457] which has been recorded as the sixth largest diaspora in the world. [458]\nImmigration\nMain article: Immigration to Pakistan\nPakistan hosts the second largest refugee population globally after Turkey. [459] An Afghan refugee girl near Tarbela Dam .\nEven after partition in 1947, Indian Muslims continued to migrate to Pakistan throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and these migrants settled mainly in Karachi and other towns of Sindh province. [460] The wars in neighboring Afghanistan during the 1980s and 1990s also forced millions of Afghan refugees into Pakistan. The Pakistan census excludes the 1.41 million registered refugees from Afghanistan , [461] who are found mainly in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and tribal belt , with small numbers residing in Karachi and Quetta . Pakistan is home to one of the world's largest refugee populations. [462] In addition to Afghans, around 2 million Bangladeshis and half a million other undocumented people live in Pakistan. They are claimed to be from other areas such as Myanmar , Iran, Iraq, and Africa. [463]\nExperts say that the migration of both Bengalis and Burmese ( Rohingya ) to Pakistan started in the 1980s and continued until 1998. Shaikh Muhammad Feroze, the chairman of the Pakistani Bengali Action Committee, claims that there are 200 settlements of Bengali-speaking people in Pakistan, of which 132 are in Karachi. They are also found in various other areas of Pakistan such as Thatta, Badin, Hyderabad, Tando Adam, and Lahore. [464] Large-scale Rohingya migration to Karachi made that city one of the largest population centres of Rohingyas in the world after Myanmar. [465] The Burmese community of Karachi is spread out over 60 of the city's slums such as the Burmi Colony in Korangi, Arakanabad, Machchar colony, Bilal colony, Ziaul Haq Colony, and Godhra Camp. [466]\nThousands of Uyghur Muslims have also migrated to the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan, fleeing religious and cultural persecution in Xinjiang, China. [467] Since 1989 thousands of Kashmiri Muslim refugees have sought refuge in Pakistan, complaining that many of the refugee women had been raped by Indian soldiers and that they were forced out of their homes by the soldiers. [468]\nUrbanisation\nMain article: Urbanisation in Pakistan\nKalma Underpass , Lahore\nSince achieving independence as a result of the partition of India , the urbanisation has increased exponentially, with several different causes. The majority of the population in the south resides along the Indus River, with Karachi the most populous commercial city. [469] In the east, west, and north, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore , Faisalabad , Rawalpindi , Islamabad , Sargodha , Gujranwala , Sialkot , Gujrat , Jhelum , Sheikhupura , Nowshera , Mardan , and Peshawar . During the period 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, more than 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more. [470]\nImmigration , from both within and outside the country, is regarded as one of the main factors contributing to urbanisation in Pakistan. One analysis of the 1998 national census highlighted the significance of the partition of India in the 1940s as it relates to urban change in Pakistan. [471] During and after the independence period, Urdu speaking Muslims from India migrated in large numbers to Pakistan, especially to the port city of Karachi , which is today the largest metropolis in Pakistan. Migration from other countries , mainly from those nearby, has further accelerated the process of urbanisation in Pakistani cities. Inevitably, the rapid urbanisation caused by these large population movements has also created new political and socio-economic challenges. In addition to immigration, economic trends such as the green revolution and political developments, among a host of other factors, are also important causes of urbanisation.

[477] Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution of Pakistan , which provides all its citizens the right to profess, practice and propagate their religion subject to law, public order, and morality. [478]\nThe majority of Pakistanis are Muslims (96.47%) followed by Hindus (2.14%) and Christians (1.27%). There are also people in Pakistan who follow other religions, such as Sikhism , Buddhism , Jainism and the minority of Parsi (who follow Zoroastrianism ). The Kalash people maintain a unique identity and religion within Pakistan. [479]\nHinduism is mostly associated with Sindhis , and Pakistan hosts major events such as the Hinglaj Yatra pilgrimage. Hindu temples may be found throughout Sindh , where the dharma features prominently. Many Hindus in Pakistan complain about the prospect of religious violence against them and being treated like second-class citizens, and many have emigrated to India or further abroad. [480]\nIn addition, some Pakistanis also do not profess any faith (such as atheists and agnostics ) in Pakistan. According to the 1998 census, people who did not state their religion accounted for 0.5% of the population.\nIslam\nSee also: Islam in Pakistan and Sufism in Pakistan\nFaisal Mosque , built in 1986 by Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay on behalf of King\nFaisal bin Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia\nIslam is the dominant religion. [481] About 96.47% of Pakistanis are Muslim, according to the 2017 Census. [447] Pakistan has the second-largest number of Muslims in the world after Indonesia. [482] and home for (10.5%) of the world's Muslim population. [483] The majority of them are Sunni and mostly follow Sufism (estimated between 75 and 95%) [484] [485] while Shias represent between 5–25%. [484] [157] [486] In 2019, the Shia population in Pakistan was estimated to be 42 million out of total population of 210 million. [487] Pakistan also has the largest Muslim city in the world ( Karachi ). [488]\nThe Ahmadis , a small minority representing 0.22–2% of Pakistan's population, [489] are officially considered non-Muslims by virtue of the constitutional amendment . [490] The Ahmadis are particularly persecuted, especially since 1974 when they were banned from calling themselves Muslims. In 1984, Ahmadiyya places of worship were banned from being called \"mosques\". [491] As of 2012 [update] , 12% of Pakistani Muslims self-identify as non-denominational Muslims . [492] There are also several Quraniyoon communities. [493] They are mainly concentratd in the Lalian Tehsil , Chiniot District , where approximately 13% of the population. [494]\nAhmadiyya proportion of each Pakistani District in 2017 according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics\nSufism , a mystical Islamic tradition, has a long history and a large following among the Sunni Muslims in Pakistan, at both the academic and popular levels. Popular Sufi culture is centered around gatherings and celebrations at the shrines of saints and annual festivals that feature Sufi music and dance. Two Sufis whose shrines receive much national attention are Ali Hajweri in Lahore (c. 12th century) [495] and Shahbaz Qalander in Sehwan , Sindh (c. 12th century). [496]\nThere are two levels of Sufism in Pakistan. The first is the 'populist' Sufism of the rural population. This level of Sufism involves belief in intercession through saints, veneration of their shrines, and forming bonds (Mureed) with a pir (saint). Many rural Pakistani Muslims associate with pirs and seek their intercession. [497] The second level of Sufism in Pakistan is 'intellectual Sufism', which is growing among the urban and educated population. They are influenced by the writings of Sufis such as the medieval theologian al-Ghazali , the Sufi reformer Shaykh Aḥmad Sirhindi , and Shah Wali Allah . [498] Contemporary Islamic fundamentalists criticise Sufism's popular character, which in their view does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of Muhammad and his companions. [499]\nHinduism\nSee also: Hinduism in Pakistan\nHindu proportion of each Pakistani District in 2017 according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics\nHinduism is the second-largest religion in Pakistan after Islam and is followed by 2.14% of the population according to the 2017 census. [500] [501] According to the 2010 Pew report, Pakistan had the fifth-largest Hindu population in the world. [502] In the 2017 census, the Hindu population was found to be 4,444,437. [503] Hindus are found in all provinces of Pakistan but are mostly concentrated in Sindh , where they account for 8.73% of the population. [500]\nUmerkot district (52.15%) is the only Hindu majority district in Pakistan. Tharparkar district has the highest population of Hindus in terms of absolute terms. Four districts in Sindh – Umerkot , Tharparkar , Mirpurkhas and Sanghar hosts more than half of the Hindu population in Pakistan. [494]\nAt the time of Pakistan's creation, the 'hostage theory' gained currency. According to this theory, the Hindu minority in Pakistan was to be given a fair deal in Pakistan in order to ensure the protection of the Muslim minority in India. [504] However, Khawaja Nazimuddin , the second\nPrime Minister of Pakistan , stated:\nI do not agree that religion is a private affair of the individual nor do I agree that in an Islamic state every citizen has identical rights, no matter what his caste, creed or faith be. [505]\nSome Hindus in Pakistan feel that they are treated as second-class citizens and many have continued to migrate to India. [480] Pakistani Hindus faced riots after the Babri Masjid demolition [506] and have experienced other attacks, forced conversions , and abductions. [507]\nChristianity and other religions\nMain article: Christianity in Pakistan\nChristian proportion of each Pakistani District in 2017 according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics\nChristians formed the next largest religious minority after Hindus, with 1.27% of the population following it. [447] The highest concentration of Christians in Pakistan is in Lahore District (5%) in Punjab province and in Islamabad Capital Territory (over 4% Christian). There is a Roman Catholic community in Karachi that was established by Goan and Tamil migrants when Karachi's infrastructure was being developed by the British during the colonial administration between World War I and World War II. [494]\nThey are followed by the Bahá'í Faith , which had a following of 30,000, then Sikhism, Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism , each back then claiming 20,000 adherents, [508] and a very small community of Jains .\n1.0% of the population identified as atheist in 2005. However, the figure rose to 2.0% in 2012 according to Gallup . [509]\nCulture and society\nMain articles: Culture of Pakistan , British heritage of Pakistan , and Public holidays in Pakistan\nA decorated truck running on the Karakorum Highway\nTruck art is a distinctive feature of Pakistani culture.\nCivil society in Pakistan is largely hierarchical, emphasising local cultural etiquette and traditional Islamic values that govern personal and political life. The basic family unit is the extended family , [510] although for socio-economic reasons there has been a growing trend towards nuclear families . [511] The traditional dress for both men and women is the Shalwar Kameez ; trousers, jeans , and shirts are also popular among men. [51] In recent decades, the middle class has increased to around 35 million and the upper and upper-middle classes to around 17 million, and power is shifting from rural landowners to the urbanised elites. [512] Pakistani festivals, including Eid-ul-Fitr , Eid-ul-Azha , Ramazan , Christmas, Easter, Holi , and Diwali , are mostly religious in origin. [510] Increasing globalisation has resulted in Pakistan ranking 56th on the A.T. Kearney /FP Globalization Index . [513]\nClothing, arts, and fashion\nMain articles: Pakistani clothing , Shalwar kameez , Sherwani , Jinnah cap , Peshawari chappal , Pakol , and Sindhi topi\nPeople in traditional clothing in the Pahari-Pothwari\nNeelum District in AJK\nThe Shalwar Kameez is the national dress of Pakistan and is worn by both men and women in all four provinces : Punjab , Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa , and Azad Kashmir . Each province has its own style of Shalwar Kameez . Pakistanis wear clothes in a range of exquisite colours and designs and in type of fabric (silk, chiffon , cotton, etc.). Besides the national dress, domestically tailored suits and neckties are often worn by men, and are customary in offices, schools, and social gatherings. [514]\nThe fashion industry has flourished in the changing environment of the fashion world. Since Pakistan came into being, its fashion has evolved in different phases and developed a unique identity. Today, Pakistani fashion is a combination of traditional and modern dress and has become a mark of Pakistani culture. Despite modern trends, regional and traditional forms of dress have developed their own significance as a symbol of native tradition. This regional fashion continues to evolve into both more modern and purer forms. The Pakistan Fashion Design Council based in Lahore organizes PFDC Fashion Week and the Fashion Pakistan Council based in Karachi organizes Fashion Pakistan Week . Pakistan's first fashion week was held in November 2009. [515]\nMedia and entertainment\nMain articles: Media of Pakistan , Cinema of Pakistan , Music of Pakistan , History of Pakistani pop music , Theatre of Pakistan , and Pakistani dramas\nThe private print media , state-owned Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV), and Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) for radio were the dominant media outlets until the beginning of the 21st century. Pakistan now has a large network of domestic, privately owned 24-hour news media and television channels . [516] A 2021 report by the Reporters Without Borders ranked Pakistan 157th among 180 nations on the Press Freedom Index , it is reported multiple times that Pakistani reporters remains in pressure and threat if reported against army, government. [517] The BBC terms the Pakistani media \"among the most outspoken in South Asia\". [518] Pakistani media has also played a vital role in exposing corruption. [519]\nThe Lollywood , Punjabi and Pashto film industry is based in Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar. While Bollywood films were banned from public cinemas from 1965 until 2008, they had remained an important part of popular culture. [520] In 2019, the screening of Bollywood movies was again faced with an indefinite ban. [521] In contrast to the ailing Pakistani film industry, Urdu televised dramas and theatrical performances continue to be popular, as many entertainment media outlets air them regularly. [522]\nUrdu dramas dominate the television entertainment industry , which has launched critically acclaimed miniseries and featured popular actors and actresses since the 1990s. [523] In the 1960s–1970s, pop music and disco (1970s) dominated the country's music industry. In the 1980s–1990s, British influenced\nrock music appeared and jolted the country's entertainment industry. [524] In the 2000s, heavy metal music gained popular and critical acclaim. [525]\nPakistani music ranges from diverse forms of provincial folk music and traditional styles such as Qawwali and Ghazal Gayaki to modern musical forms that fuse traditional and western music. [526] Pakistan has many famous folk singers. The arrival of Afghan refugees in the western provinces has stimulated interest in Pashto music, although there has been intolerance of it in some places. [527]\nDiaspora\nMain article: Overseas Pakistani\nAccording to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Pakistan has the sixth-largest diaspora in the world. [458] Statistics gathered by the Pakistani government show that there are around 7 million Pakistanis residing abroad, with the vast majority living in the Middle East, Europe, and North America. [528] Pakistan ranks 10th in the world for remittances sent home. [316] [529] The largest inflow of remittances, as of 2016 [update] , is from Saudi Arabia, amounting to $5.9 billion. [530] The term Overseas Pakistani is officially recognised by the Government of Pakistan . The Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis was established in 2008 to deal exclusively with all matters of overseas Pakistanis such as attending to their needs and problems, developing projects for their welfare, and working for resolution of their problems and issues. Overseas Pakistanis are the second-largest source of foreign exchange remittances to Pakistan after exports. Over the last several years, home remittances have maintained a steadily rising trend, with a more than 100% increase from US$8.9 billion in 2009–10 to US$19.9 billion in 2015–16. [315] [529]\nThe Overseas Pakistani Division (OPD) was created in September 2004 within the Ministry of Labour (MoL). It has since recognised the importance of overseas Pakistanis and their contribution to the nation's economy. Together with Community Welfare Attaches (CWAs) and the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF), the OPD is making efforts to improve the welfare of Pakistanis who reside abroad. The division aims to provide better services through improved facilities at airports, and suitable schemes for housing, education, and health care. It also facilitates the reintegration into society of returning overseas Pakistanis. Notable members of the Pakistani diaspora include the London Mayor\nSadiq Khan , the UK cabinet member Sajid Javid , the former UK Conservative Party chair Baroness Warsi , the singers Zayn Malik and Nadia Ali , MIT physics Professor Dr. Nergis Mavalvala , the actors Riz Ahmed and Kumail Nanjiani , the businessmen Shahid Khan and Sir Anwar Pervez , Boston University professors Adil Najam and Hamid Nawab , Texas A&M professor Muhammad Suhail Zubairy , Yale professor Sara Suleri , UC San Diego professor Farooq Azam and the historian Ayesha Jalal .\nLiterature and philosophy\nMain articles: Literature of Pakistan , Urdu poetry , and Pakistani philosophy\nMuhammad Iqbal , Pakistan's national poet who conceived the idea of Pakistan\nPakistan has literature in Urdu , Sindhi , Punjabi , Pashto , Baluchi , Persian , English , and many other languages. [531] The Pakistan Academy of Letters is a large literary community that promotes literature and poetry in Pakistan and abroad. [532] The National Library publishes and promotes literature in the country. Before the 19th century, Pakistani literature consisted mainly of lyric and religious poetry and mystical and folkloric works. During the colonial period, native literary figures were influenced by western literary realism and took up increasingly varied topics and narrative forms. Prose fiction is now very popular. [533] [534]\nThe national poet of Pakistan, Muhammad Iqbal , wrote poetry in Urdu and Persian. He was a strong proponent of the political and spiritual revival of Islamic civilisation and encouraged Muslims all over the world to bring about a successful revolution. [ clarification needed ] [535] Well-known figures in contemporary Pakistani Urdu literature include Josh Malihabadi\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz and Saadat Hasan Manto . Sadequain and Gulgee are known for their calligraphy and paintings. [534] The Sufi poets Shah Abdul Latif , Bulleh Shah , Mian Muhammad Bakhsh , and Khawaja Farid enjoy considerable popularity in Pakistan. [536]\nMirza Kalich Beg has been termed the father of modern Sindhi prose. [537] Historically, philosophical development in the country was dominated by Muhammad Iqbal , Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, Muhammad Asad , Maududi , and Mohammad Ali Johar . [538]\nIdeas from British and American philosophy greatly shaped philosophical development in Pakistan. Analysts such as M. M. Sharif and Zafar Hassan established the first major Pakistani philosophical movement in 1947. [ clarification needed ] [539] After the 1971 war, philosophers such as Jalaludin Abdur Rahim , Gianchandani , and Malik Khalid incorporated Marxism into Pakistan's philosophical thinking. Influential work by Manzoor Ahmad , Jon Elia , Hasan Askari Rizvi , and Abdul Khaliq brought mainstream social , political , and analytical philosophy to the fore in academia. [540] Works by Noam Chomsky have influenced philosophical ideas in various fields of social and political philosophy. [541]\nArchitecture\nMain articles: Pakistani architecture and Hindu, Jain and Buddhist architectural heritage of Pakistan\nThe Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam is part of Pakistan's Sufi heritage. [542]\nFour periods are recognised in Pakistani architecture: pre-Islamic , Islamic , colonial , and post-colonial . With the beginning of the Indus civilization around the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE, [543] an advanced urban culture developed for the first time in the region, with large buildings, some of which survive to this day. [544]\nMohenjo Daro , Harappa, and Kot Diji are among the pre-Islamic settlements that are now tourist attractions. [164] The rise of Buddhism and the influence of Greek civilisation led to the development of a Greco-Buddhist style, [545] starting from the 1st century CE. The high point of this era was the Gandhara style . An example of Buddhist architecture is the ruins of the Buddhist monastery Takht-i-Bahi in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. [546]\nMinar-e-Pakistan is a national monument marking Pakistan's independence movement.\nThe arrival of Islam in what is today Pakistan meant the sudden end of Buddhist architecture in the area and a smooth transition to the predominantly pictureless Islamic architecture . The most important Indo-Islamic -style building still standing is the tomb of the Shah Rukn-i-Alam in Multan. During the Mughal era, design elements of Persian-Islamic architecture were fused with and often produced playful forms of Hindustani art. Lahore, as the occasional residence of Mughal rulers, contains many important buildings from the empire. Most prominent among them are the Badshahi Mosque , the fortress of Lahore with the famous Alamgiri Gate , the colourful, Mughal -style Wazir Khan Mosque , [547] the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore, and the Shahjahan Mosque in Thatta . In the British colonial period, predominantly functional buildings of the Indo-European representative style developed from a mixture of European and Indian-Islamic components. Post-colonial national identity is expressed in modern structures such as the Faisal Mosque , the Minar-e-Pakistan , and the Mazar-e-Quaid . Several examples of architectural infrastructure demonstrating the influence of British design can be found in Lahore , Peshawar , and Karachi . [548]\nFood and drink\nMain article: Pakistani cuisine\nLocated on the bank of Arabian Sea in Karachi , Port Grand is one of the largest food streets of Asia. [549]\nTraditional food\nPakistani cuisine is similar to that of other regions of South Asia, with some of it being originated from the royal kitchens of 16th-century Mughal emperors. [550] Most of those dishes have their roots in British , Indian , Central Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine . [551] Unlike Middle Eastern cuisine, Pakistani cooking uses large quantities of spices, herbs, and seasoning. Garlic, ginger , turmeric , red chili , and garam masala are used in most dishes, and home cooking regularly includes curry, roti , a thin flatbread made from wheat, is a staple food, usually served with curry, meat, vegetables, and lentils. Rice is also common; it is served plain, fried with spices, and in sweet dishes. [160] [552]\nLassi is a traditional drink in the Punjab region . Black tea with milk and sugar is popular throughout Pakistan and is consumed daily by most of the population. [51] [553]\nSohan halwa is a popular sweet dish from the southern region of Punjab province and is enjoyed all over Pakistan. [554]\nSports\nMain article: Sport in Pakistan\nMost sports played in Pakistan originated and were substantially developed by athletes and sports fans from the United Kingdom who introduced them during the British Raj . Field hockey is the national sport of Pakistan; it has won three gold medals in the Olympic Games held in 1960 , 1968 , and 1984 . [555] Pakistan has also won the Hockey World Cup a record four times, held in 1971 , 1978 , 1982 , and 1994 . [556]\nGaddafi Stadium , Lahore , is the 3rd largest cricket stadium in Pakistan, with a seating capacity of 27,000 spectators.\nCricket , however, is the most popular game across the country. [557] The country has had an array of success in the sport over the years, and has the distinct achievement of having won each of the major ICC international cricket tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup , ICC World Twenty20 , and ICC Champions Trophy ; [558] as well as the ICC Test Championship . [559] The cricket team (known as Shaheens ) won the Cricket World Cup held in 1992 ; it was runner-up once, in 1999 . Pakistan was runner-up in the inaugural World Twenty20 (2007) in South Africa and won the 2009 World Twenty20 in England. In March 2009, militants attacked the touring Sri Lankan cricket team , [560] after which no international cricket was played in Pakistan until May 2015, when the Zimbabwean team agreed to a tour . Pakistan also won the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy by defeating arch-rivals India in the final .\nPakistan Super League is one of the largest cricket leagues of the world with a brand value of about Rs.  32.26 billion (US$110 million). [561]\nAssociation football is the second-most played sports in Pakistan, and is organised and regulated by the Pakistan Football Federation . [562]\nFootball in Pakistan is as old as the country itself. Shortly after the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) was created, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah became its first Patron-in-Chief. [563] The highest football division in Pakistan is the Pakistan Premier League . [564] Pakistan is known as one of the best manufactures of the official FIFA World Cup ball. [565] [566]\nPakistan has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1989 and 2004 South Asian Games ; the 1984 , 1993 , 1996 and 2003 World Squash Championships ; [567] the 1987 and 1996 Cricket World Cup ; [568] [569] and the 1990 Hockey World Cup . [570] Pakistan is set to host the 2023 South Asian Games , [571] the 2023 Asia Cup , [572] and the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy . [573]\nThere are also some traditional Pakistani games that are commonly played, with kabaddi being foremost among them.

Perhaps most importantly in a South Asian context, the role played by zebu makes this a distinctive, localised development, with a character completely different from other parts of the world. Finally, the longevity of the site, and its articulation with the neighbouring site of Nausharo (c. 2800—2000 BCE), provides a very clear continuity from South Asia's first farming villages to the emergence of its first cities (Jarrige, 1984).\"\n^\nWright 2009 , pp. 1–2:Quote: \"The Indus civilisation is one of three in the 'Ancient East' that, along with Mesopotamia and Pharaonic Egypt, was a cradle of early civilisation in the Old World (Childe, 1950).

Even Congress, which had always denied the League's claim to be the only true representative of Indian Muslims had to concede the truth of that claim.

Even distinguished scholars of Empire like Perry Anderson and A. G. Hopkins have made the common assumption that India naturally became a republic upon independence on 15 August 1947. Instead, all three of these South Asian states began their independent life as Realms within the British Commonwealth and mirrored the style and institutions of the Dominions of Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Though their sovereignty was in no way impaired by this seemingly ambiguous position they all held the British sovereign as their head of state who was represented in each capital by a governor- general appointed on the advice of the local prime minister. India, Pakistan and Ceylon were Realms from 1947 to 1950, 1947 to 1956 and 1948 to 1972 respectively.\n^\nMcGrath, Allen (1996). The Destruction of Pakistan's Democracy .

But Mawdūdī and his Jamāʿat-i Islāmī played the central part in the demand for an Islamic constitution.

The first important result of the combined efforts of the Jamāʿat-i Islāmī and the ʿulamāʿ was the passage of the Objectives Resolution in March 1949, whose formulation reflected compromise between traditionalists and modernists. The resolution embodied \"the main principles on which the constitution of Pakistan is to be based\". It declared that \"sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to God Almighty alone and the authority which He has delegated to the State of Pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by Him is a sacred trust\", that \"the principles of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice, as enunciated by Islam shall be fully observed\", and that \"the Muslims shall be enabled to order their lives in the individual and collective spheres in accord with the teaching and requirements of Islam as set out in the Holy Qurʿan and Sunna\".

But what is undeniable is the close association he developed with the ulama, for when he died a little over a year after Pakistan was born, Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, in his funeral oration, described Jinnah as the greatest Muslim after the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. - Dhulipala, Venkat (2015). Creating a New Medina: State Power, Islam, and the Quest for Pakistan in Late Colonial North India . Cambridge University Press. p. 489. ISBN   978-1-316-25838-5 . Similarly, Usmani asked Pakistanis to remember the Qaid's ceaseless message of Unity, Faith and Discipline and work to fulfil his dream to create a solid bloc of all Muslim states from Karachi to Ankara, from Pakistan to Morocco. He [Jinnah] wanted to see the Muslims of the world united under the banner of Islam as an effective check against the aggressive designs of their enemies\n^\nHaqqani, Hussain (2010). Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military . Carnegie Endowment. p. 16. ISBN   978-0-87003-285-1 . The first formal step toward transforming Pakistan into an Islamic ideological state was taken in March 1949 when the country's first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, presented the Objectives Resolution in the constituent assembly.\n^\nDhulipala, Venkat (2015). Creating a New Medina: State Power, Islam, and the Quest for Pakistan in Late Colonial North India . Cambridge University Press. p. 491. ISBN   978-1-316-25838-5 . Khaliq drew a sharp distinction between this Islamic state and a Muslim state. He claimed that as of now Pakistan was only a Muslim state in view of the majority of its population being Muslim, and indeed could never be an Islamic state by itself. It could certainly fulfill its promise and destiny by bringing together all the believers of Islam into one political unit and it is only then that an Islamic state would be achieved.\n^\nHaqqani, Hussain (2010). Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military . Carnegie Endowment. p. 18. ISBN   978-0-87003-285-1 . One of the earliest Western scholars of Pakistani politics, Keith Callard, observed that Pakistanis seemed to believe in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the Muslim world: Pakistan was founded to advance the cause of Muslims. Other Muslims might have been expected to be sympathetic, even enthusiastic. But this assumed that other Muslim states would take the same view of the relation between religion and nationality.\n^\nHaqqani, Hussain (2010). Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military . Carnegie Endowment. p. 18. ISBN   978-0-87003-285-1 . Pakistan's pan-Islamic aspirations, however, were neither shared nor supported by the Muslim governments of the time. Nationalism in other parts of the Muslim world was based on ethnicity, language, or territory.\n^\nHaqqqani, Hussain (2010). Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military . Carnegie Endowment. p. 19. ISBN   978-0-87003-285-1 . Although Muslim governments were initially unsympathetic to Pakistan's pan-Islamic aspirations, Islamists from the world over were drawn to Pakistan. Controversial figures such as the pro-Nazi former grand mufti of Palestine, Al-Haj Amin al-Husseini, and leaders of Islamist political movements like the Arab Muslim Brotherhood became frequent visitors to the country.\n^\nHusain Haqqani (2010).

The social scientist, Nasim Ahmad Jawed has conducted a survey of nationalism in pre-divided Pakistan and identifies the links between religion, politics and nationalism in both wings of Pakistan. His findings are fascinating and go some way to explain the differing attitudes of West and East Pakistan to the relationship between Islam and Pakistani nationalism and how this affected the views of people in both wings, especially the views of the peoples of both wings towards each other. In 1969, Jawed conducted a survey on the type of national identity that was used by educated professional people. He found that just over 60% in the East wing professed to have a secular national identity. However, in the West wing, the same figure professed an Islamic and not a secular identity. Furthermore, the same figure in the East wing described their identity in terms of their ethnicity and not in terms of Islam. He found that the opposite was the case in the West wing where Islam was stated to be more important than ethnicity.\n^\nLintner, Bertil (2004). \"Religious Extremism and Nationalism in Bangladesh\"\n(PDF) . p. 418.\n^\nDiamantides, Marinos; Gearey, Adam (2011).

Within a few years the president of the Muslim League, Chaudhry Khaliq-uz-Zaman, announced that Pakistan would bring all Muslim countries together into Islamistan – a pan-Islamic entity. None of these developments within the new country elicited approval among Americans for the idea of India's partition ... British Prime Minister Clement Attlee voiced the international consensus at the time when he told the House of Commons of his hope that 'this severance may not endure.'

The following year, Choudhry Khaliquzzaman toured the Middle East, pleading for the formation of an alliance or confederation of Muslim states.

The belief that the creation of Pakistan made Pakistan the true leader of Muslim causes around the world led Pakistan's diplomats to vigorously champion the cause of self-determination for fellow Muslims at the United Nations. Pakistan's founders, including Jinnah, supported anti-colonial movements: \"Our heart and soul go out in sympathy with those who are struggling for their freedom ... If subjugation and exploitation are carried on, there will be no peace and there will be no end to wars.\" Pakistani efforts on behalf of Indonesia (1948), Algeria (1948–1949), Tunisia (1948–1949), Morocco (1948–1956) and Eritrea (1960–1991) were significant and initially led to close ties between these countries and Pakistan.\n^\nNasir, Abbas (18 August 2015). \"The legacy of Pakistan's loved and loathed Hamid Gul\" .

His commitment to jihad—to an Islamic revolution transcending national boundaries, was such that he dreamed one day the \"green Islamic flag\" would flutter not just over Pakistan and Afghanistan, but also over territories represented by the (former Soviet Union) Central Asian republics. After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, as the director-general of the Pakistan's intelligence organisation, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate, an impatient Gul wanted to establish a government of the so-called Mujahideen on Afghan soil. He then ordered an assault using non-state actors on Jalalabad, the first major urban centre across the Khyber Pass from Pakistan, with the aim capturing it and declaring it as the seat of the new administration.\n^\nHunter, Shireen (2010).

Both Saudi Arabia and Iran used Pakistan as a battleground for their proxy war for the 'hearts and minds' of Pakistani Sunnis and Shias with the resultant rise in sectarian tensions in Pakistan. The rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan in the 1990s further strained Pakistan-Iran relations. Pakistan's support of the Sunni Pashtun organization created problems for Shia Iran for whom a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan was a nightmare.\n^\nSchmetzer, Uli (14 September 1998). \"Iran Raises Anti-pakistan Outcry\" . Chicago Tribune . Retrieved 5 January 2017 . KARACHI, Pakistan – Iran, which has amassed 200,000 troops on the border with Afghanistan, accused Pakistan on Sunday of sending warplanes to strafe and bombard Afghanistan's last Shiite stronghold, which fell hours earlier to the Taliban, the Sunni militia now controlling the central Asian country. - Constable, Pamela (16 September 1998). \"Afghanistan: Arena For a New Rivalry\" . The Washington Post . Retrieved 5 January 2017 . Taliban officials accused Iran of providing military support to the opposition forces; Tehran radio accused Pakistan of sending its air force to bomb the city in support of the Taliban's advance and said Iran was holding Pakistan responsible for what it termed war crimes at Bamiyan. Pakistan has denied that accusation and previous allegations of direct involvement in the Afghan conflict. Also fueling the volatile situation are ethnic and religious rivalries between the Taliban, who are Sunni Muslims of Afghanistan's dominant Pashtun ethnic group, and the opposition factions, many of which represent other ethnic groups or include Shiite Muslims. Iran, a Shiite Muslim state, has a strong interest in promoting that sect; Pakistan, one of the Taliban's few international allies, is about 80 percent Sunni.\n^\nPande, Aparna (2006).

Along with traditional Chinese characters , they are one of the two standard character sets of the contemporary Chinese written language . The government of the People's Republic of China in mainland China has promoted them for use in printing since the 1950s and 1960s to encourage literacy. [1] They are officially used in the People's Republic of China , Malaysia and Singapore , while traditional Chinese characters remain in common use in Hong Kong , Macau , ROC/Taiwan and Japan , as well as South Korea to a certain extent.\nSimplified Chinese characters may be referred to by their official name 简化字 ; Jiǎnhuàzì or colloquially 简体字 ; Jiǎntǐzì . In its broadest sense, the latter term refers to all characters that have undergone simplifications of character \"structure\" or \"body\", [note 2] some of which have existed for millennia mainly in handwriting alongside traditional characters. On the other hand, the official name refers to the modern systematically simplified character set, which includes not only structural simplification but also substantial reduction in the total number of standardized Chinese characters. [note 3] [3]\nSimplified character forms were created by reducing the number of strokes and simplifying the forms of a sizable proportion of Chinese characters. Some simplifications were based on popular cursive forms embodying graphic or phonetic simplifications of the traditional forms. Some characters were simplified by applying regular rules, for example, by replacing all occurrences of a certain component with a simplified version of the component. Variant characters with the same pronunciation and identical meaning were reduced to a single standardized character, usually the simplest amongst all variants in form. Finally, many characters were left untouched by simplification and are thus identical between the traditional and simplified Chinese orthographies.\nA second round of simplifications was promulgated in 1977, but was later retracted in 1986 for a variety of reasons, largely due to the confusion caused and the unpopularity of the second-round simplifications. [4]\nIn August 2009, China began collecting public comments for a modified list of simplified characters. [5] [6] [7] [8] The new Table of General Standard Chinese Characters consisting of 8,105 (simplified and unchanged) characters was officially implemented for use by the State Council of the People's Republic of China on June 5, 2013.

Caoshu , cursive written text, was the inspiration of some simplified characters, and for others, some are attested as early as the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) as either vulgar variants or original characters.\nThe first batch of simplified characters introduced in 1935, later retracted in 1936, consisted of 324 characters.\nOne of the earliest proponents of character simplification was Lufei Kui , who proposed in 1909 that simplified characters should be used in education. In the years following the May Fourth Movement in 1919, many anti-imperialist Chinese intellectuals sought ways to modernise China as quickly as possible. Traditional culture and values such as Confucianism were challenged and subsequently blamed for their problems. Soon, people in the movement started to cite the traditional Chinese writing system as an obstacle in modernising China and therefore proposed that a reform be initiated. It was suggested that the Chinese writing system should be either simplified or completely abolished. Lu Xun , a renowned Chinese author in the 20th century, stated that, \"If Chinese characters are not destroyed, then China will die\" ( 漢字不滅，中國必亡 ). Recent commentators have claimed that Chinese characters were blamed for the economic problems in China during that time. [10]\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, discussions on character simplification took place within the Kuomintang government, and a large number of the intelligentsia maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in China. [11] In 1935, 324 simplified characters collected by Qian Xuantong were officially introduced as the table of first batch of simplified characters, but they were suspended in 1936 due to fierce opposition within the party.\nAfter 1949 [ edit ]\nWithin the PRC, further character simplification became associated with the leftists of the Cultural Revolution , culminating with the second-round simplified characters , which were promulgated in 1977. In part due to the shock and unease felt in the wake of the Cultural Revolution and Mao's death, the second round of simplifications was poorly received. [ citation needed ] In 1986, the authorities retracted the second round completely. Later in the same year, the authorities promulgated a final list of simplifications, which is identical to the 1964 list except for six changes (including the restoration of three characters that had been simplified in the first round: 叠 , 覆 , 像 ; note that the form 疊 is used instead of 叠 in regions using traditional Chinese). In 1965, the PRC published the Yinshua tongyong hanzi zixing biao\n印刷通用汉字字形表 ( zh ) ( List of commonly used characters for printing ), which included the standardized printing forms of 6196 characters.\nThere had been simplification initiatives aimed at eradicating characters entirely and establishing the Hanyu Pinyin romanization as the official written system of the PRC, but the reform never gained quite as much popularity as the leftists had hoped. [ citation needed ] After the retraction of the second round of simplification, the PRC stated that it wished to keep Chinese orthography stable. Years later in 2009, the Chinese government released a major revision list which included 8,300 characters. No new simplifications were introduced. However, six characters previously listed as \"traditional\" characters that have been simplified, as well as 51 other \"variant\" characters, were restored to the standard list. In addition, orthographies (e.g., stroke shape) for 44 characters were proposed to be modified slightly to fit traditional calligraphic rules. Also, the practice of unrestricted simplification of rare and archaic characters by analogy using simplified radicals or components is now discouraged. A State Language Commission official cited \"oversimplification\" as the reason for restoring some characters. The language authority declared an open comment period until August 31, 2009, for feedback from the public. [8] The proposed orthographic changes to 44 characters were not implemented due to overwhelmingly negative public opinion. [12]\nThe officially promulgated version of the Table of General Standard Chinese Characters , announced in 2013, contained 45 newly recognized standard characters that were previously considered variant forms, as well as official approval of 226 characters that had been simplified by analogy and had seen wide use but were not explicitly given in previous lists or documents.\nSingapore and Malaysia [ edit ]\nMain article: Singapore Chinese characters\nSingapore underwent three successive rounds of character simplification, eventually arriving at the same set of simplified characters as mainland China . [13]\nThe first round, consisting of 498 simplified characters from 502 traditional characters, was promulgated by the Ministry of Education in 1969. The second round, consisting of 2287 simplified characters, was promulgated in 1974. The second set contained 49 differences from the mainland China system; those were removed in the final round in 1976. In 1993, Singapore adopted the six revisions made by mainland China in 1986. However, unlike in mainland China where personal names may only be registered using simplified characters, parents have the option of registering their children's names in traditional characters in Singapore.\nMalaysia promulgated a set of simplified characters in 1981, which were also completely identical to the simplified characters used in mainland China. Chinese-language schools use these.\nTraditional characters are still often seen on shop signs, calligraphy, and some newspapers in both countries.\nHong Kong [ edit ]\nA small group called Dou Zi Sei ( T:導字社; S:导字社 ) or Dou Zi Wui ( T:導字會; S:导字会 ) attempted to introduce a special version of simplified characters using romanizations in the 1930s. Today, however, traditional characters remain dominant in Hong Kong.\nJapan [ edit ]\nMain article: Shinjitai\nAfter World War II , Japan also simplified a number of Chinese characters ( kanji ) used in the Japanese language. The new forms are called shinjitai . Compared to Chinese, the Japanese reform was more limited, simplifying only a few hundred characters. Further, the list of simplifications was exhaustive, unlike Chinese simplification – thus analogous simplifications of not explicitly simplified characters ( extended shinjitai ) are not approved, and instead standard practice is to use the traditional forms.\nThe number of characters in circulation was also reduced, and formal lists of characters to be learned during each grade of school were established. The overall effect was to standardize teaching and the use of kanji in modern literature and media.\nMethod of simplification [ edit ]\nStructural simplification of characters\nAll characters simplified this way are enumerated in Chart 1 and Chart 2 in Jianhuazi zong biao ( 简化字总表 ), \"Complete List of Simplified Characters\" announced in 1986.\nChart 1 lists all 350 characters that are used by themselves, and can never serve as 'simplified character components'.\nChart 2 lists 132 characters that are used by themselves as well as utilized as simplified character components to further derive other simplified characters. Chart 2 also lists 14 'components' or 'radicals' that cannot be used by themselves, but can be generalized for derivation of more complex characters.\nDerivation based on simplified character components\nChart 3 lists 1,753 characters which are simplified based on the same simplification principles used for character components and radicals in Chart 2. This list is non-exhaustive, so if a character is not already found in Chart 1, 2 or 3, but can be simplified in accordance with Chart 2, the character should be simplified.\nElimination of variants of the same character\nSeries One Organization List of Variant Characters accounts for some of the orthography difference between mainland China on the one hand, and Hong Kong and Taiwan on the other. These are not simplifications of character structures, but rather reduction in number of total standard characters. For each set of variant characters that share the identical pronunciation and meaning, one character (usually the simplest in form) is elevated to the standard character set, and the rest are obsoleted. After rounds of revisions, by 1993, some 1,027 variant characters have been declared obsolete by this list. Amongst the chosen variants, those that appear in the \"Complete List of Simplified Characters\" are also simplified in character structure accordingly.\nAdoption of new standardized character forms\nNew standardized character forms originated from the \"List of character forms of General Used Chinese characters for Publishing\" containing 6,196 characters, published in 1965. The new forms tend to adopt vulgar variant forms for most of its characters. The List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese list, published in 1988, contains 7,000 commonly used characters , and replaces the 1965 list. Since the new forms take vulgar variants, many characters now appear slightly simpler compared to old forms, and as such are often mistaken as structurally simplified characters.\nStructural simplification of characters [ edit ]\nAll characters simplified this way are enumerated in Chart 1 and Chart 2 in the Complete List of Simplified Characters . Characters in both charts are structurally simplified based on similar set of principles. They are separated into two charts to clearly mark those in Chart 2 as 'usable as simplified character components', based on which Chart 3 is derived. [note 4]\nMerging two or more usually homophonous characters:\n蒙、懞、濛、矇 → 蒙 ; 復、複、覆、复 → 复 ; 乾、幹、榦、干 → 干 ; 髮、發 → 发 ; etc.\nUsing printed forms of cursive shapes ( 草書楷化 ):\n書 → 书 ; 長 → 长 ; 當 → 当 ; 韋 → 韦 ; 樂 → 乐 ; 車 → 车 ; 興 → 兴 ; 發 → 发 ; 東 → 东 ; 專 → 专 ; 過 → 过 ; 報 → 报 ; 爾 → 尔 ; 盡 → 尽 ; 學 → 学 ; etc.\nReplacing a component of a character with a simple arbitrary symbol (such as 又 and 乂 ):\n對 → 对 ; 觀 → 观 ; 僅 → 仅 ; 難 → 难 ; 鳳 → 凤 ; 這 → 这 ; 劉 → 刘 ; etc.\nOmitting entire components :\n廠 → 厂 ; 廣 → 广 ; 飛 → 飞 ; 習 → 习 ; 滅 → 灭 ; 親 → 亲 ; 業 → 业 ; 鄉 → 乡 ; 餘 → 余 ; 氣 → 气; etc.\nFurther morphing a character after omitting some components :\n婦 → 妇 ; 麗 → 丽 ; 歸 → 归 ; 顯 → 显 ; 務 → 务 ; etc.\nPreserving the basic outline or shape of the original character\n繼 → 继 ; 龜 → 龟 ; 齒 → 齿 ; 奪 → 夺 ; 門 → 门 ; 見 → 见 ; etc.\nReplacing the phonetic component of phono-semantic compound characters :\n鄰 → 邻 ; 斃 → 毙 ; 蠟 → 蜡 ; 鍾 → 钟 ; 艦 → 舰 ; etc.\nReplacing uncommon phonetic component of a character with a more common one :\n華 → 华 ; 憲 → 宪 ; 歷、曆 → 历 ; 賓 → 宾 ; etc.\nReplacing entire character with a newly coined phono-semantic compound character :\n護 → 护 ; 驚 → 惊 ; 藝 → 艺 ; 響 → 响 ; etc.\nRemoving radicals from characters\n麼 → 么 ; 開 → 开 ; 裡/裏 → 里 ; 餘 → 余 ; 關/関 → 关 ; etc.\nOnly retaining radicals from characters\n廣 → 广 ; 親 → 亲 ; 產 → 产 ; 類 → 类 ; 廠 → 厂 ; 鄉 → 乡 ; etc.\nAdopting obscure ancient forms or variants : [note 5]\n塵 → 尘 ; 膚 → 肤 ; 從 → 从 ; 眾 → 众 ; 雲 → 云 ; 網 → 网 ; 與 → 与 ; 無 → 无 ; 電 → 电 ; etc.\nAdopting ancient vulgar variants : [note 5]\n體 → 体 ; 國 → 国 ; 憑 → 凭 ; 陽 → 阳 ; 陰 → 阴 ; etc.\nRe-adopting abandoned phonetic-loan characters :\n餘 → 余 ; 後 → 后 ; 裡/裏 → 里 ; etc.\nModifying a traditional character to simplify another traditional character :\n義 → 义(乂) ; 髮、發 → 发(友) ; 龍 → 龙(尤) ; 頭 → 头(大) etc.\nDerivation based on simplified character components [ edit ]\nBased on 132 characters and 14 components listed in Chart 2 of the Complete List of Simplified Characters , the 1,753 'derived' characters found in the non-exhaustive Chart 3 can be created by systematically simplifying components using Chart 2 as a conversion table. While exercising such derivation, following rules should be observed:\nThe \"Complete List of Simplified Characters\" employs character components , not the traditional definition of radicals . A component refers to any conceivable part of a character, regardless of its position within the character, or its relative size compared to other components in the same character. For instance, in the character 摆 , not only is 扌 (a traditional radical) considered a component, but so is 罢 .\nEach of the 132 simplified characters in Chart 2, when used as a component in compound characters, systematically simplify compound characters in exactly the same way the Chart 2 character itself was simplified. For instance, 單 is simplified in Chart 2 to 单 . Based on the same principle, these derivations can be made: 彈 → 弹 ; 嬋 → 婵 ; 囅 → 冁 ; etc.\nThe 14 simplified components in Chart 2 are never used alone as individual characters. They only serve as components. Example of derived simplification based on the component 𦥯 , simplified to 𰃮 ( ), include: 學 → 学 ; 覺 → 觉 ; 黌 → 黉 ; etc.\nChart 1 collects 352 simplified characters that generally cannot be used as components . Even in rare cases where a Chart 1 character is found as a component in a compound character, the compound character cannot be simplified in the same way. For instance, 習 is simplified in Chart 1 to 习 , but 褶 cannot be simplified to ⿰衤习 .\nA character that is already explicitly listed as simplified character in the \"Complete List of Simplified Characters\" cannot be alternatively simplified based on derivation. For instance, 戰 and 誇 are simplified in Chart 1 to 战 and 夸 respectively, thus they cannot be simplified alternatively by derivation via 单 and 讠 in Chart 2 to 𢧐 and ⿰讠夸 . 過 is simplified in Chart 2 to 过 , thus it cannot be alternatively derived via 呙 in Chart 2 as 𬨨 .\nSample Derivations :\n𦥯 → 𰃮 ( ), thus 學 → 学 ; 覺 → 觉 ; 黌 → 黉 ; etc.\n單 → 单 , thus 彈 → 弹 ; 嬋 → 婵 ; 囅 → 冁 ; etc.\n頁 → 页 , thus 顏 → 颜 ; 頷 → 颔 ; 順 → 顺 ; 額 → 额 ; etc.\n專 → 专 , thus 傳 → 传 ; 轉 → 转 ; 磚 → 砖 ; etc.\n𩙿 → 饣 , thus 飯 → 饭 ; 飽 → 饱 ; 飼 → 饲 ; 餃 → 饺 ; etc.\n訁 → 讠 , thus 話 → 话 ; 語 → 语 ; 誰 → 谁 ; etc.\nElimination of variants of the same character [ edit ]\nThe \"Series One Organization List of Variant Characters\" reduces the number of total standard characters. First, amongst each set of variant characters sharing identical pronunciation and meaning, one character (usually the simplest in form) is elevated to the standard character set, and the rest are made obsolete. Then amongst the chosen variants, those that appear in the \"Complete List of Simplified Characters\" are also simplified in character structure accordingly. Some examples follow:\nSample reduction of equivalent variants :\n姪 → 侄 ; 蹤 → 踪 ; 恆 → 恒 ; 佇 → 伫 ; 虖、嘑、謼 → 呼 ; 夠 → 够 etc.\nIn choosing standard characters, often ancient variants with simple structures are preferred :\n異 → 异 ; 淚 → 泪 ; 災、烖、菑 → 灾 ; etc.\nVulgar forms simpler in structure are also chosen :\n傑 → 杰 ; 貓 → 猫 ; 豬 → 猪 ; 獃、騃 → 呆 ; etc.\nThe chosen variant was already simplified in Chart 1 :\n裏 → 裡 → 里 ; 歎 → 嘆 → 叹 ; 唘、啓 → 啟 → 启 ; 鬦、鬪、鬭 → 鬥 → 斗 ; 厤、暦 → 曆 → 历 ; 歴 → 歷 → 历 ; etc.\nIn some instances, the chosen variant is actually more complex than eliminated ones. An example is the character 搾 which is eliminated in favor of the variant form 榨 . Note that the \"hand\" radical 扌 , with three strokes, on the left of the eliminated 搾 is now \"seen\" as more complex, appearing as the \"tree\" radical 木 , with four strokes, in the chosen variant 榨 .\nNot all characters standardised in the simplified set consist of fewer strokes. For instance, the traditional character 強 , with 11 strokes is standardised as 强 , with 12 strokes, which is a variant character. Such characters do not constitute simplified characters.\nAdoption of new standardized character forms [ edit ]\nMain article: Xin Zixing\nThe new standardized character forms ( 新字形\nxīn zìxíng ) shown in the List of Character Forms of Generally Used Chinese Characters for Publishing and revised through the List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese tend to adopt vulgar variant character forms. Since the new forms take vulgar variants, many characters now appear slightly simpler compared to old forms, and as such are often mistaken as structurally simplified characters. Some examples follow:\nThe traditional component 釆 becomes 米 :\n粵 → 粤 ; 奧 → 奥 ; etc.\nThe traditional component 囚 becomes 日 :\n溫 → 温 ; 媼 → 媪 ; etc.\nThe traditional \"Break\" stroke becomes the \"Dot\" stroke :\n虛 → 虚 ; 噓 → 嘘 ; etc.\nThe traditional components ⺥ and 爫 become ⺈ :\n靜 → 静 ; 睜 → 睁 ; etc.\nThe traditional component 奐 becomes 奂 :\n換 → 换 ; 煥 → 焕 ; etc.\nInconsistencies [ edit ]\nA commonly cited example of the irregularity of simplification involves characters that share the \"hand\" component 又 , which is used in many simplified characters. While there is an observable pattern involving the replacement of 𦰩 with 又 as seen in 漢 → 汉 , 難 → 难 , 癱 → 瘫 , 嘆 → 叹 , 灘 → 滩 , etc., when observing that 歎 → 叹 , 歡 → 欢 , 勸 → 劝 , 灌 (not simplified) and 罐 (not simplified), an inconsistency arises. This is due to the fact that in the Complete List of Simplified Characters, 漢 → 汉 appears in Chart 1 while 難 → 难 is listed in Chart 2 and 癱 → 瘫 as a derived character in the non-exhaustive list in Chart 3. Therefore, 难 is defined as a 'simplified character component' according to the standard, while 又 is not. Based on 难 , 癱 is simplified to 瘫 , and 灘 to 滩 . Since both 歡 → 欢 and 勸 → 劝 appear in Chart 1, they are not defined as derived characters. There are therefore no characters or components found in Chart 2 usable for derivation of 灌 and 罐 . Further investigation reveals that these two characters do not appear in Chart 1 nor in \"Series One Organization List of Variant Characters\". Thus they remain unchanged from traditional forms in the \"List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese\".\nDistribution and use [ edit ]\nThe east square of Guangzhou railway station in 1991. Notice the prevalence of traditional Chinese characters as brand logos during that time, including Jianlibao (健力宝), Rejoice (飄柔) and 广东万家乐, only Head & Shoulders (海飞丝) printed in simplified. In mainland China, it is legal to design brand logos in traditional characters, yet, by 2020, apart from Jianlibao , the other three change to simplified.\nThe slogan 战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁! ( Zhàn wúbù shèng de Máo Zédōng sīxiǎng wànsuì! ; Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought !), in simplified script, on Xinhua Gate in Beijing.\nThe People's Republic of China and Singapore generally use simplified characters. They appear very sparingly in printed text produced in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese communities, although they are becoming more prevalent as China opens to the world. Conversely, the mainland is seeing an increase in the use of traditional forms, where they are often used on signs, and in logos, blogs, dictionaries, and scholarly works.\nMainland China [ edit ]\nThe Law of the People's Republic of China on the National Common Language and Characters implies simplified Chinese as the standard script, with traditional Chinese being used for purposes such as ceremonies, cultural purposes (e.g. calligraphy), decoration, publications and books on ancient literature and poetry, and research purposes. Traditional Chinese remains ubiquitous on buildings predating the promotion of simplified characters, such as former government buildings, religious buildings, educational institutions, and historical monuments. Traditional Chinese is also often used for commercial purposes, such as shopfront displays and advertisements.\nAs part of the one country, two systems model, the PRC has not attempted to force Hong Kong or Macau into using simplified characters. The PRC tends to print material intended for people in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and overseas Chinese in traditional characters. For example, it prints versions of the People's Daily in traditional characters and both the People's Daily and Xinhua websites have versions in traditional characters using Big5 encoding. Mainland companies selling products in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan use traditional characters on their displays and packaging to communicate with consumers (the reverse is true as well).\nDictionaries published in mainland China generally show both simplified and their traditional counterparts. In digital media, many cultural phenomena imported from Hong Kong and Taiwan into mainland China, such as music videos, karaoke videos, subtitled movies, and subtitled dramas, use traditional Chinese characters.\nHong Kong [ edit ]\nTextbooks, official statements, newspapers, including the PRC-funded media, show no signs of moving to simplified Chinese characters. However, some students may opt to use the simplified form when taking notes or doing test papers to write faster.\nIt is common for Hong Kong people to learn traditional Chinese characters in school, and some simplified Chinese in passing (either through reading mainland-published books or other media). For use on computers, however, people tend to type Chinese characters using a traditional character set such as Big5. In Hong Kong, as well as elsewhere, it is common for people who use both sets to do so because it is much easier to convert from the traditional character set to the simplified character set because of the usage of the aforementioned methods 8 and 9 of simplification. [ clarification needed ]\nTaiwan [ edit ]\nSimplified Chinese characters are not officially used in governmental and civil publications in Taiwan. However, it is legal to import simplified character publications and distribute them. Certain simplified characters that have long existed in informal writing for centuries also have popular usage, while those characters simplified originally by the Taiwanese government are much less common in daily appearance.\nIn all areas, most handwritten text will include informal simplifications (alternative script) which are not the same as the simplifications officially promulgated by the PRC and are often instead influenced by the shinjitai used in Japan. [ citation needed ] The informal simplification of the first character of \"Taiwan\", \"Taipei\", etc., from 臺 to 台 rivals its orthodox form in commonality, even in print and in answers to school exams. [14] [15] This is because the adoption of simplified characters has been gradual and predates the Chinese Civil War by several decades and some are used beyond mainland China to some extent. [16]\nSingapore and Malaysia [ edit ]\nIn Singapore, where Mandarin Chinese is one of the official languages, simplified characters are the official standard and are generally used in all official publications as well as the government-controlled press. While simplified characters are taught exclusively in schools and are generally used in all official publications, the government does not officially discourage the use of traditional characters and still allow parents to choose whether to have their child's Chinese name registered in simplified or traditional characters. Furthermore, traditional characters are widely used by older generations and are widespread on signboards, stall menus, and decorations, among others.\nIn Malaysia, Chinese is not an official language, but over 90% of ethnic-Chinese students are educated in Chinese schools, which have taught simplified characters since 1981. Likewise, traditional characters are also widely used by older generations and are widespread on signboards, etc., albeit more common than in Singapore. Most of Malaysia's Chinese newspapers compromise by retaining traditional characters in article headlines but using simplified characters for content.\nAs there is no restriction of the use of traditional characters in the mass media, television programmes, books, magazines and music CD's that have been imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan are widely available, and these almost always use traditional characters. Most karaoke discs, being imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan, have song lyrics in traditional characters as well. Many shop signs continue to be written in traditional characters. [17] Menus in hawker centres and coffee shops are also commonly seen in traditional characters.\nEducation [ edit ]\nIn general, schools in mainland China, Malaysia and Singapore use simplified characters exclusively, while schools in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan use traditional characters exclusively.\nToday, simplified Chinese characters predominate among college and university programs teaching Chinese as a foreign language outside of China, [18] such as those in the United States . [19]\nMainland China [ edit ]\nIn December 2004, Ministry of Education authorities rejected a proposal from a Beijing Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) political conference member that called for elementary schools to teach traditional Chinese characters in addition to the simplified ones. The conference member pointed out that many, especially young people, have difficulties with traditional Chinese characters; this is especially important in dealing with non-mainland communities such as Taiwan and Hong Kong. The educational authorities did not approve the recommendation, saying that it did not fit in with the \"requirements as set out by the law\" and it could potentially complicate the curricula. [20] A similar proposal was delivered to the first plenary session of the 11th CPPCC in March 2008. [21]\nHong Kong [ edit ]\nMost, if not all, Chinese language textbooks in Hong Kong are written in traditional characters. Before 1997, the use of simplified characters was generally discouraged by educators. After 1997, while students are still expected to be proficient and utilize traditional characters in formal settings, they may sometimes adopt a hybrid written form in informal settings to speed up writing. With the exception of open examinations, simplified Chinese characters are considered acceptable by the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority for their speed. [ citation needed ]\nSingapore and Malaysia [ edit ]\nChinese textbooks in Singapore and Malaysia are written exclusively in simplified characters, and only simplified characters are taught in school. Traditional characters are usually only taught to those taking up calligraphy as a co-curricular activity or Cantonese as an elective course at school.\nChinese as a foreign language [ edit ]\nFurther information: Chinese as a foreign language\nThis section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .\n( March 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )\nAs the source of many Mandarin Chinese textbooks is mainland China, the majority of textbooks teaching Chinese are now based on simplified characters and Hanyu Pinyin – although there are textbooks originating in China which have a traditional version. For practical reasons, universities and schools prepare students who will be able to communicate with mainland China, so their obvious choice is to use simplified characters.\nIn places where a particular set is not locally entrenched, such as Europe and the United States, instruction is now mostly simplified, as the economic importance of mainland China increases, and also because of the availability of textbooks printed in mainland China. Teachers of international students often recommend learning both systems.\nEurope [ edit ]\nIn the United Kingdom, universities mainly teach Mandarin Chinese at the undergraduate level using the simplified characters coupled with pinyin. However, they will require the students to learn or be able to recognise the traditional forms if they are studying in Taiwan or Hong Kong (such as taking Cantonese courses). In Australia and New Zealand, schools, universities and TAFEs use predominantly simplified characters.\nRussia and most East European nations are traditionally oriented on the education of the PRC's system for teaching Chinese, which uses simplified characters but exposes the learners to both systems.\nEast Asia [ edit ]\nIn South Korea , universities have used predominantly simplified characters since 1990s. In high school, Chinese is one of the selective subjects. By the regulation of the national curricula standards, MPS I and traditional characters had been originally used before (since the 1940s), but by the change of regulation, pinyin and simplified characters have been used to pupils who enter the school in 1996 or later. Therefore, MPS I and traditional characters disappeared after 1998 in South Korean high school Chinese curriculum.\nIn Japan there are two types of schools. Simplified Chinese is taught instead of traditional Chinese in pro-mainland China schools. They also teach Pinyin, a romanization system for standard Chinese, while the Taiwan-oriented schools teach Zhuyin , which uses phonetic symbols. However, the Taiwan-oriented schools are starting to teach simplified Chinese and Pinyin to offer a more well-rounded education. [22]\nSoutheast Asia [ edit ]\nIn the Philippines , the use of simplified characters has become increasingly popular. Before the 1970s, Chinese schools in the Philippines were under the supervision of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China. Hence, most books were using traditional characters. Traditional characters remained prevalent until the early 2000s. Institutions like the Confucius Institute , being the cultural arm of the People's Republic of China, are strong proponents of the use of simplified characters. Also, many schools are now importing their Mandarin textbooks from Singapore instead of Taiwan.\nPublic universities such as the Linguistics and Asian Languages Department of the University of the Philippines use simplified characters in their teaching materials. On the other hand, private schools such as Chiang Kai Shek College and Saint Jude Catholic School remain major proponents of the usage of traditional characters. Some private universities, such as the Ateneo de Manila University , also use simplified characters.\nComputer encoding and fonts [ edit ]\nIn computer text applications, the GB encoding scheme most often renders simplified Chinese characters, while Big5 most often renders traditional characters. Although neither encoding has an explicit connection with a specific character set, the lack of a one-to-one mapping between the simplified and traditional sets established a de facto linkage.\nSince simplified Chinese conflated many characters into one and since the initial version of the GB encoding scheme, known as GB 2312 -80, contained only one code point for each character, it is impossible to use GB 2312 to map to the bigger set of traditional characters. It is theoretically possible to use Big5 code to map to the smaller set of simplified character glyphs, although there is little market for such a product. Newer and alternative forms of GB have support for traditional characters. In particular, mainland authorities have now established GB 18030 as the official encoding standard for use in all mainland software publications. The encoding contains all East Asian characters included in Unicode 3.0. As such, GB 18030 encoding contains both simplified and traditional characters found in Big-5 and GB, as well as all characters found in Japanese and Korean encodings.\nUnicode deals with the issue of simplified and traditional characters as part of the project of Han unification by including code points for each. This was rendered necessary by the fact that the linkage between simplified characters and traditional characters is not one-to-one. While this means that a Unicode system can display both simplified and traditional characters, it also means that different localization files are needed for each type.\nThe Chinese characters used in modern Japanese (called Kanji characters) have also undergone simplification, but generally to a lesser extent than with simplified Chinese. It is worth mentioning that Japan's writing system utilizes a reduced number of Chinese characters in daily use, resulting partly from the Japanese language reforms ; thus, a number of complex characters are written phonetically. Reconciling these different character sets in Unicode became part of the controversial process of Han unification. Not surprisingly, some of the Chinese characters used in Japan are neither 'traditional' nor 'simplified'. In this case, these characters cannot be found in traditional/simplified Chinese dictionaries.\nIn font filenames and descriptions, the acronym SC is used to signify the use of simplified Chinese characters to differentiate fonts that use TC for traditional Chinese characters . [23]\nWeb pages [ edit ]\nThe World Wide Web Consortium 's Internationalization working group recommends the use of the language tag\nzh-Hans as a language attribute value and Content-Language value to specify web-page content in simplified Chinese characters. [24]\nCriticism [ edit ]\nFurther information: Debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters\nThere are ongoing disputes among users of Chinese characters related to the introduction of simplified Chinese characters.\nAuthor Liu Shahe was an outspoken critic of the simplification of Chinese characters. He wrote a dedicated column entitled \"Simplified Characters are Unreasonable\" (简化字不讲理) in the Chinese edition of the Financial Times . [25]\nTraditional Chinese supporters sometimes refer to simplified Chinese as 殘體字 ( cántǐzì – 'crippled characters').\nCriticism of the simplifications does not necessarily imply sympathy for restoration of the traditional spelling since alternative simplifications are possible. [26]\nSee also [ edit ]\nLanguage portal\nChina portal\nAmbiguities in Chinese character simplification\nChinese Character Simplification Scheme\nDebate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters\nRyakuji\nXin Zixing\nShinjitai ( 新字体 or 新字體  – Japanese simplified characters)\nDifferences between Shinjitai and Simplified characters\nTraditional Chinese characters\nNotes [ edit ]\n^\nRefer to official publications: zh:汉字简化方案 , zh:简化字总表 , etc.\n^\nThe Xiandai Hanyu Guifan Cidian defines the term as \"Chinese characters that have undergone simplification\" (经过简化的汉字). [2]\n^\nAs stated by then-Chairman Mao Zedong in 1952\n^\nAll examples listed here are sourced from 简化字#字型結構簡化#簡化方法 where all entries are associated with proper references.\n^ a\nb\nThis is very similar to the 'elimination of variants of the same character' in \"Series One Organization List of Variant Characters\", except that these eliminations happen in Chart 1 and Chart 2 of \"Complete List of Simplified Characters\". Characters simplified in Chart 2 can be further used for derivation of Chart 3, but those chosen in \"Series One Organization List of Variant Characters\" cannot.\nReferences [ edit ]\n^\n\"Jiàoyù bù jiù \"hànzì jiǎnhuà fāng'àn\" děng fābù 50 zhōunián dá jìzhě wèn\" 教育部就《汉字简化方案》等发布50周年答记者问 .

For meetings between heads of state, see Summit (meeting) . For other uses, see Summit (disambiguation) .\nClimbers from the Dominican Republic on the world's highest summit, Mount Everest .\nView from the summit of Switzerland 's highest peak, Monte Rosa\nA summit is a point on a surface that is higher in elevation than all points immediately adjacent to it. The topographic terms acme , apex , peak ( mountain peak ), and zenith are synonymous .\nThe term top ( mountain top ) is generally used only for a mountain peak that is located at some distance from the nearest point of higher elevation. For example, a big, massive rock next to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit. Summits near a higher peak, with some prominence or isolation, but not reaching a certain cutoff value for the quantities, are often considered subsummits (or subpeaks ) of the higher peak, and are considered part of the same mountain. A pyramidal peak is an exaggerated form produced by ice erosion of a mountain top. Summit may also refer to the highest point along a line, trail, or route.\nThe highest summit in the world is Mount Everest with a height of 8,848.86 m (29,031.7 ft) above sea level . The first official ascent was made by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary . They reached the mountain's peak in 1953. [1] [2]\nWhether a highest point is classified as a summit, a sub peak or a separate mountain is subjective. The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation 's definition of a peak is that it has a prominence of 30 metres (98 ft) or more; it is a mountain summit if it has a prominence of at least 300 metres (980 ft). [3] Otherwise, it's a subpeak.\nSiskiyou Mountain Summit sign along Interstate 5 , marking the highest point along the highway at 4,310 ft (1,310 m)\nIn many parts of the Western United States , the term summit can also be used for the highest point along a road, highway, or railroad, more commonly referred to as a pass . For example, the highest point along Interstate 80 in California is referred to as Donner Summit and the highest point on Interstate 5 is Siskiyou Mountain Summit . This can lead to confusion as to whether a labeled \"summit\" is a pass or a peak.\nGallery [ edit ]\nThe summit of Mount Damavand , Iran\nDoso Doyabi , one of the highest peaks entirely within Nevada , United States\nMount Elbrus and its two peaks ( Caucasus , Russia )\nSee also [ edit ]\nGeoid  – Ocean shape without winds and tides\nHill  – Landform that extends above the surrounding terrain\nNadir (topography)\nSummit accordance\nReferences [ edit ]\n^\nLyons, Kate (2017-05-21). \"Mount Everest's Hillary Step has collapsed, mountaineer confirms\" .

It is the homeland of the Tibetan people . Also resident on the plateau are some other ethnic groups such as the Monpa , Tamang , Qiang , Sherpa and Lhoba peoples and, since the 20th century, considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui settlers. Since the 1951 annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China , the entire plateau has been under the administration of the People's Republic of China . Tibet is divided administratively into the Tibet Autonomous Region , and parts of the Qinghai and Sichuan provinces.\nTibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of 4,380 m (14,000 ft). [1] [2] Located in the Himalayas , the highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest , Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848.86 m (29,032 ft) above sea level. [3]\nThe Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century. At its height in the 9th century, the Tibetan Empire extended far beyond the Tibetan Plateau, from the Tarim Basin and Pamirs in the west, to Yunnan and Bengal in the southeast. It then divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet ( Ü-Tsang ) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa , Shigatse , or nearby locations. The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling under Chinese rule; most of this area was eventually annexed into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century. [4]\nFollowing the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of the Tibet Area (Ü-Tsang). The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913, although this was not recognised by the subsequent Chinese Republican government . [5] Later, Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang . The region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when, following the Battle of Chamdo , Tibet was occupied and annexed by the People's Republic of China. The Tibetan government was abolished after the failure of the 1959 Tibetan uprising . [6] Today, China governs western and central Tibet as the Tibet Autonomous Region while the eastern areas are now mostly autonomous prefectures within Sichuan, Qinghai and other neighbouring provinces. The Tibetan independence movement [7] is principally led by the Tibetan diaspora . [8] Human rights groups have accused the Chinese government of abuses of human rights in Tibet , including torture . [9] [10]\nWith the growth of tourism in recent years, the service sector has become the largest sector in Tibet, accounting for 50.1% of the local GDP in 2020. [11] The dominant religion in Tibet is Tibetan Buddhism ; other religions include Bön , an indigenous religion similar to Tibetan Buddhism, [12]\nIslam , and Christianity . Tibetan Buddhism is a primary influence on the art , music , and festivals of the region. Tibetan architecture reflects Chinese and Indian influences. Staple foods in Tibet are roasted barley , yak meat, and butter tea .\nNames\nMap of the approximate extent of the three provinces, Ü-Tsang, Amdo, and Kham, of the Tibetan Empire (8th century) overlaid on a map of modern borders\nMain article: Definitions of Tibet\nThe Tibetan name for their land, Bod ( བོད་ ), means 'Tibet' or ' Tibetan Plateau ', although it originally meant the central region around Lhasa , now known in Tibetan as Ü ( དབུས ). [ citation needed ] The Standard Tibetan pronunciation of Bod ( [pʰøʔ˨˧˨] ) is transcribed as: Bhö in Tournadre Phonetic Transcription ; Bö in the THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription ; and Poi in Tibetan pinyin . Some scholars believe the first written reference to Bod ('Tibet') was the ancient Bautai people recorded in the Egyptian-Greek works Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (1st century CE) and Geographia ( Ptolemy , 2nd century CE), [13] itself from the Sanskrit form Bhauṭṭa of the Indian geographical tradition. [14]\nThe modern Standard Chinese\nexonym for the ethnic Tibetan region is Zangqu (Chinese: 藏区 ; pinyin: Zàngqū ), which derives by metonymy from the Tsang region around Shigatse plus the addition of a Chinese suffix qū ( 区 ), which means 'area, district, region, ward'. Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang (Chinese: 藏 ; pinyin: Zàng ), although the geographical term Xīzàng is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region . The term Xīzàng was coined during the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796–1820) through the addition of the prefix xī ( 西 , 'west') to Zang . [ citation needed ]\nThe best-known medieval Chinese name for Tibet is Tubo (Chinese: 吐蕃 ; or Tǔbō , 土蕃 or Tǔfān , 土番 ). This name first appears in Chinese characters as 土番 in the 7th century ( Li Tai ) and as 吐蕃 in the 10th century ( Old Book of Tang , describing 608–609 emissaries from Tibetan King Namri Songtsen to Emperor Yang of Sui ). In the Middle Chinese language spoken during that period, as reconstructed by William H. Baxter , 土番 was pronounced thu x -phjon , and 吐蕃 was pronounced thu x -pjon (with the x representing a shang\ntone ). [15]\nOther pre-modern Chinese names for Tibet include:\nWusiguo (Chinese: 烏斯國 ; pinyin: Wūsīguó ; cf. Tibetan: dbus , Ü , [wyʔ˨˧˨] );\nWusizang (Chinese: 烏斯藏 ; pinyin: wūsīzàng , cf. Tibetan: dbus-gtsang , Ü-Tsang );\nTubote (Chinese: 圖伯特 ; pinyin: Túbótè ); and\nTanggute (Chinese: 唐古忒 ; pinyin: Tánggǔtè , cf. Tangut ).\nAmerican Tibetologist\nElliot Sperling has argued in favor of a recent tendency by some authors writing in Chinese to revive the term Tubote (simplified Chinese: 图伯特 ; traditional Chinese: 圖伯特 ; pinyin: Túbótè ) for modern use in place of Xizang , on the grounds that Tubote more clearly includes the entire Tibetan plateau rather than simply the Tibet Autonomous Region . [16]\nThe English word Tibet or Thibet dates back to the 18th century. [17]\nHistorical linguists generally agree that \"Tibet\" names in European languages are loanwords from Semitic\nṬībat or Tūbātt ( Arabic : طيبة، توبات ; Hebrew : טובּה, טובּת ), itself deriving from Turkic\nTöbäd (plural of töbän ), literally 'The Heights'. [18]\nLanguage\nMain article: Standard Tibetan\nEthnolinguistic map of Tibet (1967)\nLinguists generally classify the Tibetan language as a Tibeto-Burman language of the Sino-Tibetan language family although the boundaries between 'Tibetan' and certain other Himalayan languages can be unclear. According to Matthew Kapstein :\nFrom the perspective of historical linguistics, Tibetan most closely resembles Burmese among the major languages of Asia. Grouping these two together with other apparently related languages spoken in the Himalayan lands, as well as in the highlands of Southeast Asia and the Sino-Tibetan frontier regions, linguists have generally concluded that there exists a Tibeto-Burman family of languages. More controversial is the theory that the Tibeto-Burman family is itself part of a larger language family, called Sino-Tibetan , and that through it Tibetan and Burmese are distant cousins of Chinese. [19]\nTibetan family in Kham attending a horse festival\nThe language has numerous regional dialects which are generally not mutually intelligible. It is employed throughout the Tibetan plateau and Bhutan and is also spoken in parts of Nepal and northern India, such as Sikkim . In general, the dialects of central Tibet (including Lhasa), Kham , Amdo and some smaller nearby areas are considered Tibetan dialects. Other forms, particularly Dzongkha , Sikkimese , Sherpa , and Ladakhi , are considered by their speakers, largely for political reasons, to be separate languages. However, if the latter group of Tibetan-type languages are included in the calculation, then 'greater Tibetan' is spoken by approximately 6 million people across the Tibetan Plateau. Tibetan is also spoken by approximately 150,000 exile speakers who have fled from modern-day Tibet to India and other countries. [ citation needed ]\nAlthough spoken Tibetan varies according to the region, the written language, based on Classical Tibetan , is consistent throughout. This is probably due to the long-standing influence of the Tibetan empire, whose rule embraced (and extended at times far beyond) the present Tibetan linguistic area, which runs from Gilgit Baltistan in the west to Yunnan and Sichuan in the east, and from north of Qinghai Lake south as far as Bhutan. The Tibetan language has its own script which it shares with Ladakhi and Dzongkha , and which is derived from the ancient Indian Brāhmī script . [20]\nStarting in 2001, the local deaf sign languages of Tibet were standardized, and Tibetan Sign Language is now being promoted across the country.\nThe first Tibetan-English dictionary and grammar book was written by Alexander Csoma de Kőrös in 1834. [21]\nHistory\nMain article: History of Tibet\nFurther information: History of European exploration in Tibet and Foreign relations of Tibet\nRishabhanatha , the first Tirthankara of Jainism , is considered to have attained nirvana near Mount Kailash in Tibet in Jain tradition. [22]\nKing Songtsen Gampo\nEarly history\nMain articles: Neolithic Tibet , Zhangzhung , and Pre-Imperial Tibet\nHumans inhabited the Tibetan Plateau at least 21,000 years ago. [23] This population was largely replaced around 3,000 BP by Neolithic immigrants from northern China, but there is a partial genetic continuity between the Paleolithic inhabitants and contemporary Tibetan populations. [23]\nThe earliest Tibetan historical texts identify the Zhang Zhung culture as a people who migrated from the Amdo region into what is now the region of Guge in western Tibet. [24] Zhang Zhung is considered to be the original home of the Bön religion. [25] By the 1st century BCE, a neighboring kingdom arose in the Yarlung valley , and the Yarlung king, Drigum Tsenpo , attempted to remove the influence of the Zhang Zhung by expelling the Zhang's Bön priests from Yarlung. [26] He was assassinated and Zhang Zhung continued its dominance of the region until it was annexed by Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century. Prior to Songtsen Gampo , the kings of Tibet were more mythological than factual, and there is insufficient evidence of their existence. [27]\nTibetan Empire\nMain article: Tibetan Empire\nMap of the Tibetan Empire at its greatest extent between the 780s and the 790s CE\nThe history of a unified Tibet begins with the rule of Songtsen Gampo (604–650   CE), who united parts of the Yarlung River Valley and founded the Tibetan Empire. He also brought in many reforms, and Tibetan power spread rapidly, creating a large and powerful empire. It is traditionally considered that his first wife was the Princess of Nepal, Bhrikuti , and that she played a great role in the establishment of Buddhism in Tibet. In 640, he married Princess Wencheng , the niece of the Chinese emperor Taizong of Tang China . [28]\nUnder the next few Tibetan kings, Buddhism became established as the state religion and Tibetan power increased even further over large areas of Central Asia , while major inroads were made into Chinese territory, even reaching the Tang 's capital Chang'an (modern Xi'an ) in late 763. [29] However, the Tibetan occupation of Chang'an only lasted for fifteen days, after which they were defeated by Tang and its ally, the Turkic Uyghur Khaganate .\nMiran fort\nThe Kingdom of Nanzhao (in Yunnan and neighbouring regions) remained under Tibetan control from 750 to 794, when they turned on their Tibetan overlords and helped the Chinese inflict a serious defeat on the Tibetans. [30]\nIn 747, the hold of Tibet was loosened by the campaign of general Gao Xianzhi , who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and Kashmir . By 750, the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian possessions to the Chinese . However, after Gao Xianzhi's defeat by the Arabs and Qarluqs at the Battle of Talas (751) and the subsequent civil war known as the An Lushan Rebellion (755), Chinese influence decreased rapidly and Tibetan influence resumed.\nAt its height in the 780s to 790s, the Tibetan Empire reached its highest glory when it ruled and controlled a territory stretching from modern day Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, China, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan.\nIn 821/822   CE, Tibet and China signed a peace treaty. A bilingual account of this treaty, including details of the borders between the two countries, is inscribed on a stone pillar which stands outside the Jokhang temple in Lhasa. [31] Tibet continued as a Central Asian empire until the mid-9th century, when a civil war over succession led to the collapse of imperial Tibet. The period that followed is known traditionally as the Era of Fragmentation , when political control over Tibet became divided between regional warlords and tribes with no dominant centralized authority. An Islamic invasion from Bengal took place in 1206.\nYuan dynasty\nMain articles: Mongol conquest of Tibet and Tibet under Yuan rule\nThe Mongol Yuan dynasty , c. 1294\nThe Mongol Yuan dynasty , through the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs , or Xuanzheng Yuan, ruled Tibet through a top-level administrative department. One of the department's purposes was to select a dpon-chen (\"great administrator\"), usually appointed by the lama and confirmed by the Mongol emperor in Beijing. [32] The Sakya lama retained a degree of autonomy, acting as the political authority of the region, while the dpon-chen held administrative and military power. Mongol rule of Tibet remained separate from the main provinces of China, but the region existed under the administration of the Yuan dynasty . If the Sakya lama ever came into conflict with the dpon-chen , the dpon-chen had the authority to send Chinese troops into the region. [32]\nTibet retained nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative [33] rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. This existed as a \" diarchic structure\" under the Yuan emperor, with power primarily in favor of the Mongols. [32] Mongolian prince Khuden gained temporal power in Tibet in the 1240s and sponsored Sakya Pandita , whose seat became the capital of Tibet. Drogön Chögyal Phagpa , Sakya Pandita's nephew became Imperial Preceptor of Kublai Khan , founder of the Yuan dynasty.\nYuan control over the region ended with the Ming overthrow of the Yuan and Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen 's revolt against the Mongols. [34] Following the uprising, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen founded the Phagmodrupa dynasty , and sought to reduce Yuan influences over Tibetan culture and politics. [35]\nPhagmodrupa, Rinpungpa and Tsangpa dynasties\nMain articles: Phagmodrupa dynasty , Rinpungpa , and Tsangpa\nFurther information: Sino-Tibetan relations during the Ming dynasty\nGyantse Fortress\nBetween 1346 and 1354, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen toppled the Sakya and founded the Phagmodrupa dynasty. The following 80 years saw the founding of the Gelug school (also known as Yellow Hats) by the disciples of Je Tsongkhapa , and the founding of the important Ganden , Drepung and Sera monasteries near Lhasa. However, internal strife within the dynasty and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family Rinpungpa , based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435. In 1565 they were overthrown by the Tsangpa dynasty of Shigatse which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect.\nRise of Ganden Phodrang\nThe Khoshut Khanate , 1642–1717\nTibet in 1734.

[36]\nUnified heartland under Buddhist Gelug school\nMain article: Ganden Phodrang\nThe 5th Dalai Lama (1617-1682) is known for unifying the Tibetan heartland under the control of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism , after defeating the rival Kagyu and Jonang sects and the secular ruler, the Tsangpa prince, in a prolonged civil war. His efforts were successful in part because of aid from Güshi Khan , the Oirat leader of the Khoshut Khanate . With Güshi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the Lhasa state . This Tibetan regime or government is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang .\nQing dynasty\nMain articles: Chinese expedition to Tibet (1720) and Tibet under Qing rule\nPotala Palace\nQing dynasty rule in Tibet began with their 1720 expedition to the country when they expelled the invading Dzungars . Amdo came under Qing control in 1724, and eastern Kham was incorporated into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728. [37] Meanwhile, the Qing government sent resident commissioners called Ambans to Lhasa. In 1750, the Ambans and the majority of the Han Chinese and Manchus living in Lhasa were killed in a riot , and Qing troops arrived quickly and suppressed the rebels in the next year. Like the preceding Yuan dynasty, the Manchus of the Qing dynasty exerted military and administrative control of the region, while granting it a degree of political autonomy. The Qing commander publicly executed a number of supporters of the rebels and, as in 1723 and 1728, made changes in the political structure and drew up a formal organization plan. The Qing now restored the Dalai Lama as ruler, leading the governing council called Kashag , [38] but elevated the role of Ambans to include more direct involvement in Tibetan internal affairs. At the same time, the Qing took steps to counterbalance the power of the aristocracy by adding officials recruited from the clergy to key posts. [39]\nFor several decades, peace reigned in Tibet, but in 1792, the Qing Qianlong Emperor sent a large Chinese army into Tibet to push the invading Nepalese out. This prompted yet another Qing reorganization of the Tibetan government, this time through a written plan called the \"Twenty-Nine Regulations for Better Government in Tibet\". Qing military garrisons staffed with Qing troops were now also established near the Nepalese border. [40] Tibet was dominated by the Manchus in various stages in the 18th century, and the years immediately following the 1792 regulations were the peak of the Qing imperial commissioners' authority; but there was no attempt to make Tibet a Chinese province. [41]\nIn 1834, the Sikh Empire invaded and annexed Ladakh , a culturally Tibetan region that was an independent kingdom at the time. Seven years later, a Sikh army led by General Zorawar Singh invaded western Tibet from Ladakh, starting the Sino-Sikh War . A Qing-Tibetan army repelled the invaders but was in turn defeated when it chased the Sikhs into Ladakh. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Chushul between the Chinese and Sikh empires. [42]\nPutuo Zongcheng Temple , a Buddhist temple complex in Chengde , Hebei, built between 1767 and 1771. The temple was modeled after the Potala Palace .\nAs the Qing dynasty weakened, its authority over Tibet also gradually declined, and by the mid-19th century, its influence was minuscule. Qing authority over Tibet had become more symbolic than real by the late 19th century, [43] [44] [45] [46] although in the 1860s, the Tibetans still chose for reasons of their own to emphasize the empire's symbolic authority and make it seem substantial. [47]\nIn 1774, a Scottish\nnobleman , George Bogle , travelled to Shigatse to investigate prospects of trade for the East India Company . His efforts, while largely unsuccessful, established permanent contact between Tibet and the Western world . [48] However, in the 19th century, tensions between foreign powers and Tibet increased. The British Empire was expanding its territories in India into the Himalayas , while the Emirate of Afghanistan and the Russian Empire were both doing likewise in Central Asia . [ citation needed ]\nIn 1904, a British expedition to Tibet , spurred in part by a fear that Russia was extending its power into Tibet as part of the Great Game , was launched. Although the expedition initially set out with the stated purpose of resolving border disputes between Tibet and Sikkim , it quickly turned into a military invasion. The British expeditionary force, consisting of mostly Indian troops , quickly invaded and captured Lhasa, with the Dalai Lama fleeing to the countryside. [49] Afterwards, the leader of the expedition, Sir Francis Younghusband , negotiated the Convention Between Great Britain and Tibet with the Tibetans, which guaranteed the British great economic influence but ensured the region remained under Chinese control . The Qing imperial resident, known as the Amban , publicly repudiated the treaty, while the British government, eager for friendly relations with China, negotiated a new treaty two years later known as the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet . The British agreed not to annex or interfere in Tibet in return for an indemnity from the Chinese government, while China agreed not to permit any other foreign state to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet. [49]\nIn 1910, the Qing government sent a military expedition of its own under Zhao Erfeng to establish direct Manchu-Chinese rule and, in an imperial edict, deposed the Dalai Lama, who fled to British India. Zhao Erfeng defeated the Tibetan military conclusively and expelled the Dalai Lama's forces from the province. His actions were unpopular, and there was much animosity against him for his mistreatment of civilians and disregard for local culture.

Their hereditary occupation included disposal of corpses and leather work.\nMain article: Tibet (1912–51)\nAfter the Xinhai Revolution (1911–12) toppled the Qing dynasty and the last Qing troops were escorted out of Tibet, the new Republic of China apologized for the actions of the Qing and offered to restore the Dalai Lama's title. [50] The Dalai Lama refused any Chinese title and declared himself ruler of an independent Tibet . [51] In 1913, Tibet and Mongolia concluded a treaty of mutual recognition . [52] For the next 36 years, the 13th Dalai Lama and the regents who succeeded him governed Tibet. During this time, Tibet fought Chinese warlords for control of the ethnically Tibetan areas in Xikang and Qinghai (parts of Kham and Amdo) along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River . [53] In 1914, the Tibetan government signed the Simla Convention with Britain, which recognized Chinese suzerainty over Tibet in return for a border settlement. China refused to sign the convention and lost its suzerain rights. [54]\nWhen in the 1930s and 1940s the regents displayed negligence in affairs, the Kuomintang Government of the Republic of China took advantage of this to expand its reach into the territory. [55] On December 20, 1941, Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-Shek noted in his diary that Tibet would be among the territories which he would demand as restitution for China following the conclusion of World War II. [56]\nFrom 1950 to present\nMain article: History of Tibet (1950–present)\nA poster saying \"Thank you India. 50 years in Exile.\" Manali , 2010.\nEmerging with control over most of mainland China after the Chinese Civil War , the People's Republic of China\nannexed Tibet in 1950 and negotiated the Seventeen Point Agreement with the newly enthroned 14th Dalai Lama 's government, affirming the People's Republic of China's sovereignty but granting the area autonomy. Subsequently, on his journey into exile, the 14th Dalai Lama completely repudiated the agreement, which he has repeated on many occasions. [57] [58] According to the CIA , the Chinese used the Dalai Lama to gain control of the military's training and actions. [59]\nThe Dalai Lama had a strong following as many people from Tibet looked at him not just as their political leader, but as their spiritual leader. [60] After the Dalai Lama's government fled to Dharamsala , India, during the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion , it established a rival government-in-exile . Afterwards, the Central People's Government in Beijing renounced the agreement and began implementation of the halted social and political reforms. [61] During the Great Leap Forward , between 200,000 and 1,000,000 Tibetans may have died [62] and approximately 6,000 monasteries were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution —destroying the vast majority of historic Tibetan architecture. [63]\nIn 1980, General Secretary and reformist Hu Yaobang visited Tibet and ushered in a period of social, political, and economic liberalization. [64] At the end of the decade, however, before the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 , monks in the Drepung and Sera monasteries started protesting for independence. The government halted reforms and started an anti- separatist campaign. [64] Human rights organisations have been critical of the Beijing and Lhasa governments' approach to human rights in the region when cracking down on separatist convulsions that have occurred around monasteries and cities, most recently in the 2008 Tibetan unrest .\nThe central region of Tibet is now an autonomous region within China, the Tibet Autonomous Region . The Tibet Autonomous Region is a province-level entity of the People's Republic of China. It is governed by a People's Government, led by a chairman. In practice, however, the chairman is subordinate to the branch secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). As a matter of convention, the chairman has almost always been an ethnic Tibetan, while the party secretary has always been ethnically non-Tibetan. [65]\nGeography\nMain article: Geography of Tibet\nTibetan Plateau and surrounding areas above 1600 m – topography . [66] [67] Tibet is often called the \"roof of the world\".\nHimalayas, on the southern rim of the Tibetan plateau\nAll of modern China, including Tibet, is considered a part of East Asia. [68] Historically, some European sources also considered parts of Tibet to lie in Central Asia . Tibet is west of the Central China plain . In China, Tibet is regarded as part of 西部 ( Xībù ), a term usually translated by Chinese media as \"the Western section\", meaning \"Western China\".\nMountains and rivers\nView over Lhasa, 1993\nYarlung Tsangpo River\nTibet has some of the world's tallest mountains, with several of them making the top ten list. Mount Everest , located on the border with Nepal , is, at 8,848.86 metres (29,032 ft), the highest mountain on earth. Several major rivers have their source in the Tibetan Plateau (mostly in present-day Qinghai Province). These include the Yangtze , Yellow River , Indus River , Mekong , Ganges , Salween and the Yarlung Tsangpo River ( Brahmaputra River ). [69] The Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon , along the Yarlung Tsangpo River , is among the deepest and longest canyons in the world.\nTibet has been called the \"Water Tower\" of Asia, and China is investing heavily in water projects in Tibet. [70] [71]\nYamdrok Lake\nThe Indus and Brahmaputra rivers originate from the vicinities of Lake Mapam Yumco in Western Tibet, near Mount Kailash . The mountain is a holy pilgrimage site for both Hindus and Tibetans. The Hindus consider the mountain to be the abode of Lord Shiva . The Tibetan name for Mount Kailash is Khang Rinpoche. Tibet has numerous high-altitude lakes referred to in Tibetan as tso or co . These include Qinghai Lake , Lake Manasarovar , Namtso , Pangong Tso , Yamdrok Lake , Siling Co , Lhamo La-tso , Lumajangdong Co , Lake Puma Yumco , Lake Paiku , Como Chamling , Lake Rakshastal , Dagze Co and Dong Co . The Qinghai Lake (Koko Nor) is the largest lake in the People's Republic of China.\nClimate\nThe climate is severely dry nine months of the year, and average annual snowfall is only 46 cm (18 inches), due to the rain shadow effect . Western passes receive small amounts of fresh snow each year but remain traversible all year round. Low temperatures are prevalent throughout these western regions, where bleak desolation is unrelieved by any vegetation bigger than a low bush, and where the wind sweeps unchecked across vast expanses of arid plain. The Indian monsoon exerts some influence on eastern Tibet. Northern Tibet is subject to high temperatures in the summer and intense cold in the winter.\nClimate data for Lhasa (1986−2015 normals, extremes 1951−2022)\nMonth\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nYear\nRecord high °C (°F)\n20.5 (68.9)\n21.3 (70.3)\n25.1 (77.2)\n25.9 (78.6)\n29.4 (84.9)\n30.8 (87.4)\n30.4 (86.7)\n27.2 (81.0)\n26.5 (79.7)\n24.8 (76.6)\n22.8 (73.0)\n20.1 (68.2)\n30.8 (87.4)\nAverage high °C (°F)\n8.4 (47.1)\n10.1 (50.2)\n13.3 (55.9)\n16.3 (61.3)\n20.5 (68.9)\n24.0 (75.2)\n23.3 (73.9)\n22.0 (71.6)\n20.7 (69.3)\n17.5 (63.5)\n12.9 (55.2)\n9.3 (48.7)\n16.5 (61.7)\nDaily mean °C (°F)\n−0.3 (31.5)\n2.3 (36.1)\n5.9 (42.6)\n9.0 (48.2)\n13.1 (55.6)\n16.7 (62.1)\n16.5 (61.7)\n15.4 (59.7)\n13.8 (56.8)\n9.4 (48.9)\n3.8 (38.8)\n−0.1 (31.8)\n8.8 (47.8)\nAverage low °C (°F)\n−7.4 (18.7)\n−4.7 (23.5)\n−0.8 (30.6)\n2.7 (36.9)\n6.8 (44.2)\n10.9 (51.6)\n11.4 (52.5)\n10.7 (51.3)\n8.9 (48.0)\n3.1 (37.6)\n−3 (27)\n−6.8 (19.8)\n2.7 (36.8)\nRecord low °C (°F)\n−16.5 (2.3)\n−15.4 (4.3)\n−13.6 (7.5)\n−8.1 (17.4)\n−2.7 (27.1)\n2.0 (35.6)\n4.5 (40.1)\n3.3 (37.9)\n0.3 (32.5)\n−7.2 (19.0)\n−11.2 (11.8)\n−16.1 (3.0)\n−16.5 (2.3)\nAverage precipitation mm (inches)\n0.9 (0.04)\n1.8 (0.07)\n2.9 (0.11)\n8.6 (0.34)\n28.4 (1.12)\n75.9 (2.99)\n129.6 (5.10)\n133.5 (5.26)\n66.7 (2.63)\n8.8 (0.35)\n0.9 (0.04)\n0.3 (0.01)\n458.3 (18.06)\nAverage precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm)\n0.6\n1.2\n2.1\n5.4\n9.0\n14.0\n19.4\n19.9\n14.6\n4.1\n0.6\n0.4\n91.3\nAverage relative humidity (%)\n26\n25\n27\n36\n41\n48\n59\n63\n59\n45\n34\n29\n41\nMean monthly sunshine hours\n250.9\n231.2\n253.2\n248.8\n280.4\n260.7\n227.0\n214.3\n232.7\n280.3\n267.1\n257.2\n3,003.8\nPercent possible sunshine\n78\n72\n66\n65\n66\n61\n53\n54\n62\n80\n84\n82\n67\nSource 1: China Meteorological Administration, [72] all-time extreme temperature [73] [74]\nSource 2: China Meteorological Administration National Meteorological Information Center\nClimate data for Leh (1951–1980)\nMonth\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nYear\nRecord high °C (°F)\n8.3 (46.9)\n12.8 (55.0)\n19.4 (66.9)\n23.9 (75.0)\n28.9 (84.0)\n34.8 (94.6)\n34.0 (93.2)\n34.2 (93.6)\n30.6 (87.1)\n25.6 (78.1)\n20.0 (68.0)\n12.8 (55.0)\n34.8 (94.6)\nAverage high °C (°F)\n−2.0 (28.4)\n1.5 (34.7)\n6.5 (43.7)\n12.3 (54.1)\n16.2 (61.2)\n21.8 (71.2)\n25.0 (77.0)\n25.3 (77.5)\n21.7 (71.1)\n14.6 (58.3)\n7.9 (46.2)\n2.3 (36.1)\n12.8 (55.0)\nAverage low °C (°F)\n−14.4 (6.1)\n−11.0 (12.2)\n−5.9 (21.4)\n−1.1 (30.0)\n3.2 (37.8)\n7.4 (45.3)\n10.5 (50.9)\n10.0 (50.0)\n5.8 (42.4)\n−1.0 (30.2)\n−6.7 (19.9)\n−11.8 (10.8)\n−1.3 (29.7)\nRecord low °C (°F)\n−28.3 (−18.9)\n−26.4 (−15.5)\n−19.4 (−2.9)\n−12.8 (9.0)\n−4.4 (24.1)\n−1.1 (30.0)\n0.6 (33.1)\n1.5 (34.7)\n−4.4 (24.1)\n−8.5 (16.7)\n−17.5 (0.5)\n−25.6 (−14.1)\n−28.3 (−18.9)\nAverage rainfall mm (inches)\n9.5 (0.37)\n8.1 (0.32)\n11.0 (0.43)\n9.1 (0.36)\n9.0 (0.35)\n3.5 (0.14)\n15.2 (0.60)\n15.4 (0.61)\n9.0 (0.35)\n7.5 (0.30)\n3.6 (0.14)\n4.6 (0.18)\n105.5 (4.15)\nAverage rainy days\n1.3\n1.1\n1.3\n1.0\n1.1\n0.4\n2.1\n1.9\n1.2\n0.4\n0.5\n0.7\n13.0\nAverage relative humidity (%) (at 17:30 IST )\n51\n51\n46\n36\n30\n26\n33\n34\n31\n27\n40\n46\n38\nSource: India Meteorological Department [75] [76]\nRegions\nBasum Tso in Gongbo'gyamda County , eastern Tibet\nCultural Tibet consists of several regions.

Lhasa is Tibet's traditional capital and the capital of Tibet Autonomous Region. [78] It contains two world heritage sites – the Potala Palace and Norbulingka , which were the residences of the Dalai Lama. Lhasa contains a number of significant temples and monasteries, including Jokhang and Ramoche Temple .\nShigatse is the second largest city in the Tibet AR, west of Lhasa. Gyantse and Qamdo are also amongst the largest.\nOther cities and towns in cultural Tibet include Shiquanhe (Gar), Nagchu , Bamda , Rutog , Nyingchi , Nedong , Coqên , Barkam , Sagya , Gertse , Pelbar , Lhatse , and Tingri ; in Sichuan, Kangding (Dartsedo); in Qinghai, Jyekundo (Yushu), Machen , and Golmud ; in India, Tawang , Leh , and Gangtok , and in Pakistan, Skardu , Kharmang , and Khaplu .\nWildlife\nSus scrofa expanded from its origin in southeast Asia into the Plateau, acquiring and fixing adaptive alleles for the high-altitude environment. [79] The forests of Tibet are home to black bears, red pandas, musk deer, barking deer, and squirrels. Monkeys such as rhesus macaques and langurs live in the warmer forest zones. Tibetan antelopes, gazelles, and kiangs gaze on the grasslands of the Tibetan plateau. There are more than 500 bird species in Tibet. Because of the high altitude and harsh climate, there are few insects in Tibet. [78]\nSnow leopards are hunted for their fur and the eggs of black-necked cranes have been collected as a delicacy food.\nEconomy\nThis section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.\n( October 2021 )\nMain article: Economy of Tibet\nThe Tibetan yak is an integral part of Tibetan life.\nThe Tibetan economy is dominated by subsistence agriculture . Due to limited arable land, the primary occupation of the Tibetan Plateau is raising livestock, such as sheep , cattle, goats , camels , yaks , dzo , and horses .\nThe main crops grown are barley , wheat, buckwheat , rye , potatoes, and assorted fruits and vegetables. Tibet is ranked the lowest among China's 31 provinces [80] on the Human Development Index according to UN Development Programme data. [81] In recent years, due to increased interest in Tibetan Buddhism, tourism has become an increasingly important sector, and is actively promoted by the authorities. [82] Tourism brings in the most income from the sale of handicrafts. These include Tibetan hats, jewelry (silver and gold), wooden items, clothing, quilts, fabrics, Tibetan rugs and carpets. The Central People's Government exempts Tibet from all taxation and provides 90% of Tibet's government expenditures. [83] [84] [85] [86] However most of this investment goes to pay migrant workers who do not settle in Tibet and send much of their income home to other provinces. [87]\nPastoral nomads constitute about 40% of the ethnic Tibetan population. [88]\nForty percent of the rural cash income in the Tibet Autonomous Region is derived from the harvesting of the fungus Ophiocordyceps sinensis (formerly Cordyceps sinensis ); contributing at least 1.8 billion yuan, (US$225 million) to the region's GDP. [89]\nTromzikhang market in Lhasa\nThe Qingzang railway linking the Tibet Autonomous Region to Qinghai Province was opened in 2006, but it was controversial. [90] [91] [92]\nIn January 2007, the Chinese government issued a report outlining the discovery of a large mineral deposit under the Tibetan Plateau . [93] The deposit has an estimated value of $128 billion and may double Chinese reserves of zinc, copper, and lead. The Chinese government sees this as a way to alleviate the nation's dependence on foreign mineral imports for its growing economy. However, critics worry that mining these vast resources will harm Tibet's fragile ecosystem and undermine Tibetan culture. [93]\nOn January 15, 2009, China announced the construction of Tibet's first expressway, the Lhasa Airport Expressway , a 37.9 km (23.5 mi) stretch of controlled-access highway in southwestern Lhasa. The project will cost 1.55 billion yuan (US$227 million). [94]\nFrom January 18–20, 2010, a national conference on Tibet and areas inhabited by Tibetans in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Qinghai was held in China and a plan to improve development of the areas was announced. The conference was attended by General secretary Hu Jintao , Wu Bangguo , Wen Jiabao , Jia Qinglin , Li Changchun , Xi Jinping , Li Keqiang , He Guoqiang and Zhou Yongkang , all members of Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party . The plan called for improvement of rural Tibetan income to national standards by 2020 and free education for all rural Tibetan children. China has invested 310 billion yuan (about 45.6 billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet since 2001. [95] [ better source needed ]\nDevelopment zone\nThe State Council approved Tibet Lhasa Economic and Technological Development Zone as a state-level development zone in 2001. It is located in the western suburbs of Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region. It is 50 kilometres (31 miles) away from the Gonggar Airport , and 2 km (1.2 mi) away from Lhasa Railway Station and 2 km (1.2 mi) away from 318 national highway.\nThe zone has a planned area of 5.46 km 2 (2.11 sq mi) and is divided into two zones. Zone A developed a land area of 2.51 km 2 (0.97 sq mi) for construction purposes. It is a flat zone, and has the natural conditions for good drainage. [96]\nDemographics\nSee also: History of Tibet (1950–present) and Demographics of Tibet Autonomous Region\nTibetan Lamanis, c.  1905\nAn elderly Tibetan woman in Lhasa\nHistorically, the population of Tibet consisted of primarily ethnic Tibetans and some other ethnic groups. According to tradition the original ancestors of the Tibetan people, as represented by the six red bands in the Tibetan flag , are: the Se, Mu, Dong, Tong, Dru and Ra. Other traditional ethnic groups with significant population or with the majority of the ethnic group residing in Tibet (excluding a disputed area with India ) include Bai people , Blang , Bonan , Dongxiang , Han , Hui people , Lhoba , Lisu people , Miao , Mongols , Monguor (Tu people) , Menba (Monpa) , Mosuo , Nakhi , Qiang , Nu people , Pumi , Salar , and Yi people .\nThe proportion of the non-Tibetan population in Tibet is disputed. On the one hand, the Central Tibetan Administration of the Dalai Lama accuses China of actively swamping Tibet with migrants in order to alter Tibet's demographic makeup. [97] On the other hand, according to the 2010 Chinese census ethnic Tibetans comprise 90% of a total population of 3 million in the Tibet Autonomous Region .

Bön is the indigenous religion of Tibet, but has been almost eclipsed by Tibetan Buddhism, a distinctive form of Mahayana and Vajrayana , which was introduced into Tibet from the Sanskrit Buddhist tradition of northern India. [99] Tibetan Buddhism is practiced not only in Tibet but also in Mongolia , parts of northern India, the Buryat Republic , the Tuva Republic , and in the Republic of Kalmykia and some other parts of China. During China's Cultural Revolution , nearly all Tibet's monasteries were ransacked and destroyed by the Red Guards . [100] [101] [102] A few monasteries have begun to rebuild since the 1980s (with limited support from the Chinese government) and greater religious freedom has been granted – although it is still limited. Monks returned to monasteries across Tibet and monastic education resumed even though the number of monks imposed is strictly limited. [100] [103] [104] Before the 1950s, between 10 and 20% of males in Tibet were monks. [105]\nTibetan Buddhism has five main traditions (the suffix pa is comparable to \"er\" in English):\nGelug(pa) , Way of Virtue , also known casually as Yellow Hat , whose spiritual head is the Ganden Tripa and whose temporal head is the Dalai Lama . Successive Dalai Lamas ruled Tibet from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries. This order was founded in the 14th to 15th centuries by Je Tsongkhapa , based on the foundations of the Kadampa tradition. Tsongkhapa was renowned for both his scholasticism and his virtue. The Dalai Lama belongs to the Gelugpa school, and is regarded as the embodiment of the Bodhisattva of Compassion. [106]\nKagyu(pa) , Oral Lineage . This contains one major subsect and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to Gampopa . In turn, the Dagpo Kagyu consists of four major sub-sects: the Karma Kagyu , headed by a Karmapa , the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. The once-obscure Shangpa Kagyu , which was famously represented by the 20th-century teacher Kalu Rinpoche , traces its history back to the Indian master Niguma, sister of Kagyu lineage holder Naropa . This is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic.\nNyingma(pa) , The Ancient Ones . This is the oldest, the original order founded by Padmasambhava .\nSakya(pa) , Grey Earth , headed by the Sakya Trizin , founded by Khon Konchog Gyalpo, a disciple of the great translator Drokmi Lotsawa. Sakya Pandita 1182–1251 CE was the great-grandson of Khon Konchog Gyalpo. This school emphasizes scholarship.\nJonang(pa) Its origins in Tibet can be traced to early 12th century master Yumo Mikyo Dorje , but became much wider known with the help of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen , a monk originally trained in the Sakya school. The Jonang school was widely thought to have become extinct in the late 17th century at the hands of the 5th Dalai Lama , who forcibly annexed the Jonang monasteries to his Gelug school, declaring them heretical. Thus, Tibetologists were astonished when fieldwork turned up several active Jonangpa monasteries, including the main monastery, Tsangwa, located in Zamtang County, Sichuan. Almost 40 monasteries, comprising about 5000 monks, have subsequently been found, including some in the Amdo Tibetan and rGyalgrong areas of Qinghai , Sichuan and Tibet. One of the primary supporters of the Jonang lineage in exile has been the 14th Dalai Lama of the Gelugpa lineage. The Jonang tradition has recently officially registered with the Tibetan Government in exile to be recognized as the fifth living Buddhist tradition of Tibetan Buddhism . The 14th Dalai Lama assigned Jebtsundamba Khutuktu of Mongolia (who is considered to be an incarnation of Taranatha) as the leader of the Jonang tradition.\nThe Chinese government continued to pursue a strategy of forced assimilation and suppression of Tibetan Buddhism, as demonstrated by the laws designed to control the next reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and those of other Tibetan eminent lamas. Monks and nuns who refused to denounce the Dalai Lama have been expelled from their monasteries, imprisoned, and tortured. [107]\nIt was reported in June 2021 that amidst the 2020–2022 China–India skirmishes , the People's Liberation Army had been forming a new unit for Tibetans who would be taken to Buddhist monks for religious blessings after completing their training. [108]\nChristianity\nThe first Christians documented to have reached Tibet were the Nestorians , of whom various remains and inscriptions have been found in Tibet. They were also present at the imperial camp of Möngke Khan at Shira Ordo, where they debated in 1256 with Karma Pakshi (1204/6-83), head of the Karma Kagyu order. [109] [110] Desideri, who reached Lhasa in 1716, encountered Armenian and Russian merchants. [111]\nRoman Catholic Jesuits and Capuchins arrived from Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. Portuguese missionaries Jesuit Father António de Andrade and Brother Manuel Marques first reached the kingdom of Gelu in western Tibet in 1624 and was welcomed by the royal family who allowed them to build a church later on. [112] [113] By 1627, there were about a hundred local converts in the Guge kingdom. [114] Later on, Christianity was introduced to Rudok , Ladakh and Tsang and was welcomed by the ruler of the Tsang kingdom , where Andrade and his fellows established a Jesuit outpost at Shigatse in 1626. [115]\nIn 1661 another Jesuit, Johann Grueber , crossed Tibet from Sining to Lhasa (where he spent a month), before heading on to Nepal. [116] He was followed by others who actually built a church in Lhasa. These included the Jesuit Father Ippolito Desideri , 1716–1721, who gained a deep knowledge of Tibetan culture, language and Buddhism, and various Capuchins in 1707–1711, 1716–1733 and 1741–1745, [117] Christianity was used by some Tibetan monarchs and their courts and the Karmapa sect lamas to counterbalance the influence of the Gelugpa sect in the 17th century until in 1745 when all the missionaries were expelled at the lama's insistence. [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123]\nIn 1877, the Protestant\nJames Cameron from the China Inland Mission walked from Chongqing to Batang in Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture , Sichuan province, and \"brought the Gospel to the Tibetan people.\" Beginning in the 20th century, in Dêqên Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan, a large number of Lisu people and some Yi and Nu people converted to Christianity. Famous earlier missionaries include James O. Fraser , Alfred James Broomhall and Isobel Kuhn of the China Inland Mission, among others who were active in this area. [124] [125]\nProselytising has been illegal in China since 1949. But as of 2013 [update] , many Christian missionaries were reported to be active in Tibet with the tacit approval of Chinese authorities, who view the missionaries as a counterforce to Tibetan Buddhism or as a boon to the local economy. [126]\nIslam\nMain article: Islam in Tibet\nThe Lhasa Great Mosque\nMuslims have been living in Tibet since as early as the 8th or 9th century. In Tibetan cities, there are small communities of Muslims , known as Kachee (Kache), who trace their origin to immigrants from three main regions: Kashmir (Kachee Yul in ancient Tibetan), Ladakh and the Central Asian Turkic countries. Islamic influence in Tibet also came from Persia. A Muslim Sufi Syed Ali Hamdani preached to the people of Baltistan , then known as little Tibet. After 1959, a group of Tibetan Muslims made a case for Indian nationality based on their historic roots to Kashmir and the Indian government declared all Tibetan Muslims Indian citizens later on that year. [127] Other Muslim ethnic groups who have long inhabited Tibet include Hui , Salar , Dongxiang and Bonan . There is also a well established Chinese Muslim community (gya kachee), which traces its ancestry back to the Hui ethnic group of China.\nTibetan art\nMain article: Tibetan art\nTibetan representations of art are intrinsically bound with Tibetan Buddhism and commonly depict deities or variations of Buddha in various forms from bronze Buddhist statues and shrines, to highly colorful thangka paintings and mandalas . [ citation needed ] Thangkas are Tibet's traditional cloth paintings. Rendered on cotton cloth with a thin rod at the top, they portray Buddhist deities or themes in color and detail. [78]\nA ceremonial priest's yak bone apron – courtesy the Wovensouls Collection\nA thangka painting in Sikkim\nA ritual box\nArchitecture\nMain article: Tibetan culture § Architecture\nTibetan architecture contains Chinese and Indian influences, and reflects a deeply Buddhist approach. The Buddhist wheel , along with two dragons, can be seen on nearly every Gompa in Tibet. The design of the Tibetan Chörtens can vary, from roundish walls in Kham to squarish, four-sided walls in Ladakh .\nThe most distinctive feature of Tibetan architecture is that many of the houses and monasteries are built on elevated, sunny sites facing the south, and are often made out of a mixture of rocks, wood, cement and earth. Little fuel is available for heat or lighting, so flat roofs are built to conserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed to let in sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a precaution against the frequent earthquakes in this mountainous area.\nStanding at 117 metres (384 feet) in height and 360 metres (1,180 feet) in width, the Potala Palace is the most important example of Tibetan architecture. Formerly the residence of the Dalai Lama , it contains over one thousand rooms within thirteen stories, and houses portraits of the past Dalai Lamas and statues of the Buddha. It is divided between the outer White Palace, which serves as the administrative quarters, and the inner Red Quarters, which houses the assembly hall of the Lamas, chapels, 10,000 shrines, and a vast library of Buddhist scriptures. The Potala Palace is a World Heritage Site , as is Norbulingka , the former summer residence of the Dalai Lama.\nMusic\nMain article: Music of Tibet\nThe music of Tibet reflects the cultural heritage of the trans-Himalayan region, centered in Tibet but also known wherever ethnic Tibetan groups are found in India, Bhutan , Nepal and further abroad. First and foremost Tibetan music is religious music , reflecting the profound influence of Tibetan Buddhism on the culture.\nTibetan music often involves chanting in Tibetan or Sanskrit , as an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables. Other styles include those unique to the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism, such as the classical music of the popular Gelugpa school, and the romantic music of the Nyingmapa , Sakyapa and Kagyupa schools. [128]\nNangma dance music is especially popular in the karaoke bars of the urban center of Tibet, Lhasa . Another form of popular music is the classical gar style, which is performed at rituals and ceremonies. Lu are a type of songs that feature glottal vibrations and high pitches. There are also epic bards who sing of Gesar , who is a hero to ethnic Tibetans.\nFestivals\nMain article: Tibetan festivals\nThe Monlam Prayer Festival\nTibet has various festivals, many for worshipping the Buddha, [129] that take place throughout the year. Losar is the Tibetan New Year Festival. Preparations for the festive event are manifested by special offerings to family shrine deities, painted doors with religious symbols, and other painstaking jobs done to prepare for the event. Tibetans eat Guthuk (barley noodle soup with filling) on New Year's Eve with their families. The Monlam Prayer Festival follows it in the first month of the Tibetan calendar , falling between the fourth and the eleventh days of the first Tibetan month. It involves dancing and participating in sports events, as well as sharing picnics. The event was established in 1049 by Tsong Khapa, the founder of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama's order.\nCuisine\nMain article: Tibetan cuisine\nSee also: List of Tibetan dishes\nThe most important crop in Tibet is barley , and dough made from barley flour—called tsampa —is the staple food of Tibet. This is either rolled into noodles or made into steamed dumplings called momos . Meat dishes are likely to be yak , goat, or mutton , often dried, or cooked into a spicy stew with potatoes. Mustard seed is cultivated in Tibet, and therefore features heavily in its cuisine. Yak yogurt , butter and cheese are frequently eaten, and well-prepared yogurt is considered something of a prestige item. Butter tea is a very popular drink.\nThukpa with Momo – Tibetan Style\nSee also\nChina portal\nAsia portal\nIndex of Tibet-related articles\nList of Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Tibet\nOutline of Tibet\nSinicization of Tibet\nChinese Settlements in Tibet\nFree Tibet\nReferences\nCitations\n^\n\"Altitude sickness may hinder ethnic integration in the world's highest places\" .
