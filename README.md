# mountain-search-engine
A search engine to search data about mountains. This search engine is built as part of a class project for the Information Retrieval class. 

## The main tasks performed as a part of implementation of this search-engine are as follows:
1. Crawling the web for relevant information and pages about mountains.
2. Indexing the crawled data and getting relevance results based on the Pagerank and HITS algorithm.
3. Building a UI to display the search results from our search engine as well as comparing results from Google and Bing. 
4. Performing flat and agglomerative clustering on the indexed data.
5. Query expansion to extract relevant results based on the user's query.

## We have used the following popular open-source tools for our technology stack.
1. Apache Nutch 
2. Apache Solr
3. Python
4. Java
5. Flask
